The boy I loved had been one of my best friends from the time we were 9 years old,” the actress wrote in a personal essay published on <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> in 2017. “In my 20s, when I was starting out my career as an actor, I wasn’t looking for a relationship, but one found me and became serious, even though I hadn’t planned to settle down until my 30s. But when the person you’re with asks you to marry him, you think:&nbsp;This must be happening because it’s supposed to.”</p><p>Bush married <a href=#><strong>Chad Michael Murray</strong></a> in April 2005. After their split the following year, the <a href=#>John Tucker Must Die</a> actress went on to date fellow <a href=#>One Tree Hill </a>castmates <a href=#><strong>James Lafferty</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Austin Nichols</strong> </a>and former <a href=#>Chicago P.D.</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Jesse Lee Soffer</strong></a>.</p><p>Back in 2014, Bush admitted she <a href=#>“dated a couple of the wrong guys,”</a> but also said she had a “great love” in her life.</p><p>Since 2020, the Chalet Girl star has been dating <a href=#><strong>Grant Hughes</strong></a>, an entrepreneur who cofounded the organization FocusMotion Health, based in Santa Monica. The pair were <a href=#>first spotted together in May</a> of that year, holding hands while taking a stroll through Malibu.</p><p>In June 2021, the couple attended the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of Bush’s Hulu film False Positive, also starring <a href=#><strong>Ilana Glazer</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Justin Theroux</strong></a>. Though they’ve been spotted out together a few times, the actress has largely kept the relationship private.</p><p>“It’s hard to have nothing that’s yours,” the Drunk History alum told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in June 2021, explaining why she’s dialed back the amount of personal details she shares with the public. “And when you are a person who lives in the public eye, everybody wants to pick over everything and that can be really tricky.”</p><p>She added that she’d rather use her fame to discuss the issues that are important to her, like women’s rights and environmental justice. “I don’t really hide what’s going on in my life, but I don’t flaunt it,” she told ET.</p><p>In August 2021, the <a href=#>This Is Us</a> alum <a href=#>confirmed that she and Hughes were engaged</a>. “So it turns out that being your favorite person’s favorite person is the actual best feeling on planet Earth,” she wrote via Instagram, alongside a photo of the entrepreneur proposing to her in Lake Como, Italy. “My heart. It bursts.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Multiple sources confirmed to Us <a href=#>that the couple exchanged vows on June 11, 2022</a>, in front of family and friends at Philbrook Art Museum in Tulsa County, Oklahoma.</p><p>Scroll through for the actress’ complete dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLC8x6KYZpqlqLW0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snoop-dogg-isnt-quitting-weed-after-all-heres-why-he-trolled-everyone.html><span>←</span><span>Snoop Dogg isnt quitting weed after all heres why he trolled everyone ?</span></a>
