Across its six seasons, the cast stole viewers’ hearts, making it even harder to say goodbye to the show earlier this year.</p><p>“I highly respect Dan’s decision to end the show even though I think all of us wanted to keep going,” Hampshire, 39, told Us Weekly exclusively in April. “Now that I know how it ends, it’s the right thing because he respects the characters and fans by the way he ends his show. … I can say that <a href=#>he does right by everyone</a>. I can’t believe how amazing the ending is.”</p><p>The Levys confirmed in March 2019 that the Rose family’s journey would not continue for a seventh season, telling fans in a statement at the time that <a href=#>he was “grateful” for the opportunity</a> to create such a well-rounded story “in its totality.”</p><p>“It’s not lost on us what a rare privilege it is in this industry to get to decide when your show should take its final bow. We could never have dreamed that our fans would grow to love and care about these characters in the ways that you have,” the statement continued.</p><p>Fans weren’t the only ones made emotional by the thought of <a href=#>saying goodbye to Schitt’s Creek</a> — its stars were equally broken-hearted.</p><p>“It was really, really hard,” Dan, 37, told <a href=#>GQ</a> in November 2019. “The last day of shooting was <a href=#>the most emotional day</a> I think I’ve ever had in my life. I cried for, I want to say, five straight hours, to the point where I had a splitting headache and didn’t know what to do with my life.”</p><p>Each of the cast members put their whole heart into this show — and their hard work paid off. In July, the series scored an unprecedented number of nominations for the <a href=#>2020 Emmy Awards</a>, including Outstanding Comedy Series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to learn 12 surprising facts about the creation of Schitt’s Creek!</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19mf27Ax6KloKtdrry2ecyinqGsXaO8tXnKp6awZZGXvLbAjKyaoaGkqcBur9GenKRn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terron-brooks-net-worth-62052.html><span>←</span><span>Terron Brooks Net Worth</span></a>
