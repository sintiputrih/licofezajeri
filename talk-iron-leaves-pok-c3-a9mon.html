This works in Japanese and many other languages.--<b><a href=# title="User:Team Rocket Grunt"><span>Rocket</span></a> <a href=# title="User talk:Team Rocket Grunt"><span>Grunt</span></a></b> 17:34, 15 July 2023 (UTC)</p>Like, it kinda makes sense, but i'm also not sure if we should add the name thing in because i don't think it's the MAIN reason, you know. If i had to trace Game Freak's thoughts, it's prolly like, the legendary birds already had their unique forms, the super-ancient Pokémon and the creation trio have these deep earthen lore associated with them, etc. The legendary beasts and the Swords of Justice aren't <i>that</i> similar, but they are kinda like, idk, "minor" legendaries in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately these are all just speculations though, so idk. <a href=# title=User:Anzasquiddles>Anzasquiddles</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Anzasquiddles">talk</a>) 20:28, 16 July 2023 (UTC)<h2><span id=Walking_Wake_and_Iron_Leaves_officially_referred_to_as_Legendary_Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Walking_Wake_and_Iron_Leaves_officially_referred_to_as_Legendary_Pokémon>Walking Wake and Iron Leaves officially referred to as Legendary Pokémon</span></h2><p>Walking Wake and Iron Leaves were officially referred to as Legendary Pokémon when the event debuted, despite having a base stat total under 600. Is this a mistake by the Pokémon Company? Is that why Bulbapedia does not list them as Legendary Pokémon? Or are we, Bulbapedia, in the wrong? Please think on this issue. --<a href=# title=User:CuteShaymin>CuteShaymin</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:CuteShaymin">talk</a>) 05:34, 30 April 2024 (UTC)</p>Do you have a source where they are stated to be legendary Pokémon? <a href=# title=User:Landfish7><span><b>Land</b></span></a><a href=# title="User talk:Landfish7"><span><b>fish7</b></span></a> 08:51, 30 April 2024 (UTC) I swear they were called Legendary in the first Poke Portal news article about them, but I can't find it --<a href=# title=User:CuteShaymin>CuteShaymin</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:CuteShaymin">talk</a>) 09:18, 30 April 2024 (UTC) Sorry buddym but per the rules unless we have ofical source that these two are Legendary Pokemon offically bt Pokemon Company, we cannot add that. Its that same reason why Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, Iron Boulder, and Iron Crown are not refered as legnedary pokemon either. Yo sure you did not misread it? I chekck both main pokemon site and Scarlet and Violet offical site, not once were these paradox duo refered to as Legendary Pokemon.--<a href=# title=User:Jacob9594>Jacob9594</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Jacob9594">talk</a>) 12:25, 30 April 2024 (UTC) I did a <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>search</a> of the Poké Portal News feed and didn't see any instances of these Paradox Pokémon referred to as Legendary. <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>This</a> is the first Poké Portal News article acknowledge them. --<a href=# title=User:Apopheniac>Apopheniac</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Apopheniac">talk</a>) 14:23, 30 April 2024 (UTC) I just know they were called Legendary in the original article, the Pokémon Company seems to have deleted it. Maybe you need to search with archive.org to find it --<a href=# title=User:CuteShaymin>CuteShaymin</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:CuteShaymin">talk</a>) 17:51, 30 April 2024 (UTC) The earliest capture (Feb 28th) of the first Poké Portal News article does not say they are Legendary. Even if it did say they were Legendary and it was later removed, it was probably an accident, considering no other source says this. <a href=# title=User:Minibug>Minibug</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Minibug">talk</a>) 17:57, 30 April 2024 (UTC) It was like the time Arceus was mistaken writen as LEgendary pokemon on english legends arceus page.--<a href=# title=User:Jacob9594>Jacob9594</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Jacob9594">talk</a>) 18:54, 30 April 2024 (UTC) (Resettng indent) TPCI and Nintendo have both made additional errors in various news posts, such as saying Walking Wake and Iron Leaves would be available in 7 Star black raid crystals on the official twitter accounts, (on <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>two</a> <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>separate</a> occasions, a year apart), despite them appearing in standard 5 Star crystals. Even if we could find said instances, I don't think one-time instances of them accidentally referring to them as Legendary despite all other evidence to the contrary is enough to solidify them as Legendary "officially". <a href=# class=new title="User:Atrius97 (page does not exist)">Atrius97</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Atrius97">talk</a>) 07:33, 2 May 2024 (UTC)<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4murbeZgqmopo%2BBsqLCxKyWYYifoHKEf4R6cKannl4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./record-labels-nft-centric-gorillaz-knock-off-band-stirs-controversy.html><span>←</span><span>Record Labels NFT-Centric Gorillaz Knock-Off Band Stirs Controversy</span></a>
