Sugarhill’s horoscope sign is Pisces.</p><p>The rapper might be young but he has already experienced a lot more than his age might suggest. According to various interviews with Rap outlets like No Jumper and PPhilms, SugarHill used to work the streets while only 11 and 12.</p><p>However, through being outside, the rapper would make connections with other rappers and eventually find himself in front of a mic. Chief among these were rappers like Edot Baby, who would invite SugarHill to appear in his videos.</p><p>Edot would also be the one to tell SugarHill to start getting serious about music, and it was through his belief and guidance that the rapper started making the music he is known for today.</p><p>Sadly, Edot would pass away just as SugarHill’s career started to get off the launching pad, adding a dose of tragedy to the rapper’s origins.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-is-sugarhill-ddot-real-name><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-sugarhill-ddot-real-name></span> What Is SugarHill Ddot Real Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Per Imdb, SugarHill Ddot real name is&nbsp;<strong>Darrian Jimenez</strong>.&nbsp;However, the rapper dislikes people using his real name.</p><p>One of the reasons why is due to the tragic passing of his friend, Notti Osama, back on July 9, 2022. Since then, the rapper and his most loyal followers have been hounding people to stop using his real name when appearing in the comments.</p><p>The rapper is from a Dominican family, which is evident by his last name but has not discussed his heritage in interviews. Instead, the rapper seems to take more pride in his city, his affiliations with his friends, and the music that he is making.&nbsp;</p><p>As for his stage name, SugarHill Ddot, he represents his hometown, Sugarhill through the first name, while the last name comes from his real first name, Darrian.</p><p>Ddot is not the only rapper from his area to use the SugarHill name, as there is another rapper named SugarHill Keem, who he often collaborates with.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=where-is-rapper-sugarhill-ddot-from><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-rapper-sugarhill-ddot-from></span> Where Is Rapper SugarHill Ddot From?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>SugarHill Ddot is from Harlem, New York. More specifically, he is from a neighborhood called Sugar Hill.</p><p>Sugar Hill used to be an affluent town back in the 1920s, during a period called the Harlem Renaissance. Many prominent and wealthy African Americans like activists Thurgood Marshall and Roy Wilkins, and musicians like Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway made their homes in the neighborhood.</p><p>However, the area had long since lost its luster when the rapper was born and brought up there. As mentioned above, the rapper had to hustle from a young age simply to make a living on the unforgiving streets of Harlem.</p><p>The violence in the streets affected SugarHill directly when his friend and collaborator, Nottie Osama, would get stabbed and passed away at the 137th Street/City College subway station on July 9, 2022.</p><p>As an altercation gone wrong, what happened to Nottie is just a small example of the rough life SugarHill has had to live.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-is-sugarhill-ddot-net-worth><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-sugarhill-ddot-net-worth></span> What Is SugarHill Ddot Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>SugarHill Ddot net worth is $300,000. The amount is quite large for a rapper just over a year into his career.</p><p>Though only 14 years old, it is important to remember that the rapper has already released an album in 2021, and over 12 singles in 2021 and 2022. One of SugarHill’s songs, “Everybody Shot” from his debut album, PSA, has already surpassed a million streams on Spotify.</p><p>The rapper has seen even more success on YouTube where his most popular song, “I Wanna Love You” has already amassed over 5.2 million views. In fact, the rapper has over six videos on his YouTube channel that have either reached or surpassed a million views.</p><p>Plus, his other videos have each received hundreds of thousands of views, and even his least-viewed song has over 69K. Aside from just music, the rapper has also recently signed to Capital Records, and now has label backing, all while only 14.</p><h2 id=sugarhill-ddot-height-how-tall-is-the-rapper><span class=ez-toc-section id=sugarhill-ddot-height-%e2%80%93-how-tall-is-the-rapper></span> SugarHill Ddot Height – How Tall Is The Rapper?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>SugarHill Ddot height is 5 feet 1 inch. Due to his youth, the rapper is still growing.</p><p>At only 14, the rapper’s height is sure to change in the coming years, though he is already taller than many of his fans, friends, and family. SugarHill also has a lean build but still looks very much like any other young teenager.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his short height, a look at any of the rapper’s videos will show just how menacing he can be when rapping his violent and subversive bars backed by menacing music.</p><p>The rapper carries himself with all of the weight and experiences that sometimes rappers twice his age sometimes fail to do.</p><h2 id=does-sugarhill-ddot-have-a-girlfriend><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-sugarhill-ddot-have-a-girlfriend></span> Does Sugarhill Ddot Have A Girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>SugarHill Ddot girlfriend is reportedly a woman named <strong>Destiny</strong>. Destiny has since deleted her social media due to fan reaction.&nbsp;</p><p>On September 4, 2022, a gossip page on&nbsp;Instagram called Please Don’t Lack, posted a carousel of videos by a girl name Shynice Richardson, who stated that SugarHill was dating a woman named Destiny.</p><p>Apparently, this woman was not only much older than SugarHill, but that too by a large margin as she was well into her 20s.</p><p>The news alarmed many fans who were quick to denounce the woman and tell the young rapper that he was being victimized. Shynice posted an Instagram story on her account where she stated that apparently, the rapper’s grandmother herself had reported the older woman, but it’s unclear if the two are still together or not.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKulnK6ztMilo2aclKTBbq7IqJ6rmaCdxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mara-beauty-sea-silk-lip-balm.html><span>←</span><span>Mara Beauty Sea Silk Lip Balm Review</span></a>
