It’s a way to cope.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KwsLjIp2SsrJ%2BqtKl5wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2ZtYGiAdIWYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-lala-from-teletubbies-nikky-smedley-character-death-as-rip-post-takes-over-twitter-2.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Lala From Teletubbies?
