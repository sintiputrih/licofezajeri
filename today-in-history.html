Then known as the “President’s House,” it was the first public building to be erected in the country’s capital. The building was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born architect who modeled the residence after Leinster House in Dublin, today’s home of the Irish Parliament.</p><p>Most of the construction was performed by enslaved and free African Americans alongside European immigrants, most of whom lacked citizenship. Eight years after laborers first broke ground, John Adams became the first president to live in the White House, a tradition his successors have since followed.</p><h2>1925: Margaret Thatcher Is Born</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-385893 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/today-in-history-october-13.jpg alt="Today In History October 13" width=600 height=901 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-385893 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Margaret Thatcher giving a speech in 1984.</span></p><p>Margaret Hilda Roberts, later known as Margaret Thatcher, is born in Lincolnshire, England. The first female prime minister of the United Kingdom, Thatcher won three consecutive elections beginning in 1979 and instituted several conservative policies like deregulating businesses, privatizing state-owned companies, and crippling the power of labor unions like the National Union of Mineworkers.</p><p>In 1982, she led the country through the Falklands War, cementing her power until the end of the decade and earning her the moniker the “Iron Lady.”</p><h2>1945: Milton Hershey Dies</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Milton Hershey</a> dies in Hershey, Pennsylvania, of pneumonia at the age of 88.

He beat White over the head with a baseball bat and later claimed that he looked like the Biblical Jonah and had telepathically told him, “Kill me so that others will be saved.”</p><p>Believing that human sacrifices could avert a cataclysmic earthquake, Mullin went on to murder 12 more people in the next four months. He was arrested in February 1973 after a witness saw him kill his 13th victim and he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison.</p><h2>2010: Chilean Miners Are Rescued After 69 Days</h2><p>Thirty-three miners trapped in the San Jose gold and copper mine in Santiago, Chile, are rescued after 69 days.
