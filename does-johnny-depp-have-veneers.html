It also helps make a smile look as natural as possible. In her video, Dr. Sara says that Snap-On smiles "look good but they're not meant for long term use," as "food and saliva get underneath." In other words, it sounds as though Depp only uses his Snap-On teeth for his roles. That said, Dr. Sara also added that it looked like Depp had his gold veneers removed, which could explain why he has a little discoloration in some of his front teeth.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, Dr. Sara ended her Depp edition of her "Veneer Check" by claiming that "I think we can all agree that courtroom Johnny is just so charming." Well, it seems like there are plenty of people out there who would agree to that statement, <a href=#>including some of Depp's exes</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmhnaoN2e8OonKxlmqS1r7rYZpueqKBitaLCxGatnqaVmr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wolfgang-marguerres-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Wolfgang Marguerres Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
