Because of his demeanor, he has won over many fans. Despite the conflict, he is the CEO of four businesses in the United Arab Emirates. Ebraheem referred to Salem as his “brother” when he first met Dubai Bling, but they soon got into a battle over Danya, their co-star. For its second season on Netflix, the show welcomed back both original cast members and newcomers like Salem. When he referred to Danya as a “child” at the dinner party, chaos ensued.</p><p>After referring to DJ Bliss’ wife Danya as a child who should “stay at home,” Salem made quite the appearance on Dubai Bling. However, viewers believe he was unconcerned by the turmoil between Ebraheem and Danya. It swiftly descended into wild drama when Ebraheem Al Samadi and Salem talked about Danya, calling her a “child,” as she listened in the corner during a dinner party on the Alula trip.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Salem Khammas Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Salem Khammas’s net worth is above $50 million.</p><p>In the United Arab Emirates, Salem serves as the chairman of four construction companies: Abraj Constructions, Autocad Construction, Kunoz Engr Consultancy, and Shamal GT, according to his <a href=#>LinkedIn</a>.

In July 2021, his company secured the “largest project with the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah.”</p><p>Due to his achievements, CEO and entrepreneur Salem is thought to have a millionaire net worth similar to that of his co-stars, having worked for billionaires like Naveen Jindal. Naveen is an Indian billionaire industrialist, philanthropist, and a former Member of Parliament.</p><p>Because of his work as a chairman and entrepreneur, Salem travels the world, visiting places like Paris and Japan. He served as executive director for Al Ahli, a renowned aluminum, glass, and cladding contractor in the United Arab Emirates. He currently serves as chairman of four businesses, one of which he owns.</p><p>Salem’s career began as a bank manager at <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank in 2002. He quit his job there in 2007. He was also an executive director at Al Ahli Holding Group for 9 years from 2007 to 2015.</span></p><p>Besides his job, Salem is also into horse beauty competitions. “All thanks and appreciation to the technical staff of the Fujairah Arabian Horse Championship.
