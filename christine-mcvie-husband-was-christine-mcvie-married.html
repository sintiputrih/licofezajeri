She died at the age of 79 years old.</p><p>Christine McVie was born to Cyril Percy Absell Perfect and Beatrice Edith Maud Perfect. Her father, Cyril was a concert violinist and music lecturer at&nbsp;St. Peters College of Education at Saltley in Birmingham, and her mother, Beatrice was a medium, psychic, and faith healer. Her grandfather was also an organist at Westminster Abbey.</p><p>Christine McVie was raised in Smethwick’s Bearwood neighborhood, close to Birmingham. She was first exposed to the piano when she was four years old, but she didn’t begin studying it actively until she was eleven years old. Philip Fisher, a local musician and John McVie’s older brother’s school friend, reintroduced her to music at that time.</p><p><a href=#><strong>READ ALSO: Christine McVie Children: Did Christine McVie Have Any Kids?</strong></a></p><p>When her brother John brought home a Fats Domino songbook, McVie, who had continued her classical studies up until the age of 15, decided to turn her musical attention to rock and roll. The Everly Brothers were among other early inspirations.</p><p>Christine McVie spent five years majoring in sculpture at Birmingham’s Moseley School of Art with the intention of teaching art. She made a number of new friends in Britain’s blues community around that period.</p><p>She first entered the music industry after becoming acquaintances with Stan Webb and Andy Silvester, members of the band Sounds Of Blue. They invited McVie to join because they recognized her musical talent.</p><p>She frequently performed alongside Spencer Davis. By the time McVie finished from art school, Sounds of Blue had broken up. Unable to afford to break into the art world, she relocated to London and took a short-term job as a department shop window dresser.</p><p>She was primarily recognized as a keyboardist and singer for the band Fleetwood Mac, which she joined in 1970. Three solo albums were also released by her.</p><p>Her lyrics were primarily about relationships and love. McVie was an “unabashedly easy-on-the-ears singer/songwriter, and the key mover behind some of Fleetwood Mac’s biggest songs,” according to Steve Leggett of AllMusic. Eight songs, including “Don’t Stop,” “Everywhere,” and “Little Lies,” that she wrote or co-wrote were included on Fleetwood Mac’s 1988 Greatest Hits CD.</p><p>As a member of Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and honored with the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. McVie was given a Gold Badge of Merit Award by Basca, now known as The Ivors Academy, in 2006.</p><p>She was honored with the Trailblazer Award at the UK Americana Awards in 2021 after receiving the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors in 2014. Additionally, she was the winner of two Grammys.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Christine McVie Husband: Was Christine McVie married?</h2><p>Christine McVie was not married at the time of her death. However, she was previously married to John McVie in 1968 and divorced in 1976. They still maintained a very good professional relationship and remained friends.</p><p>She then married the Portuguese keyboardist and songwriter, Edin Quintela in 1986 and they divorced in 2003.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpyfq6GjqbavsYymmq%2BhlWK1tr%2FBmqWdZaeWwG6vx6ugrKyZo7JuucKvoJ5lnZa%2Fs7XEnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-to-do-with-unidentified-items-in-hogwarts-legacy.html><span>←</span><span>What to do with unidentified items in Hogwarts Legacy</span></a>
