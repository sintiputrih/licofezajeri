Ballistic yelled, "What you mean, why I’m mad?... Get the f*ck inside, man. Party the f*ck over, man... You think this a game?" The two take their argument inside where Joseline continues to ask him why he's upset as she laughed in his face.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Ballistic hits a glass off of the table before walking away from her.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You a nut, man," he told Joseline.
