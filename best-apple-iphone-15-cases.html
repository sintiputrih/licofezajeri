Now is the time to pounce, as the newest additions to Apple's legendary roster were confirmed <a href=#>at its September 2023 event</a>. The belles of the ball this year have to be the upgraded <a href=#>iPhone 15</a> and <a href=#>iPhone 15 Plus</a> models, which have finally received the design update the <a href=#>iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a href=#>iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> received last year. Now equipped with the Dynamic Island across the hole-punch selfie camera, the gulf between the iPhone and iPhone Pro has lessened again.</p><p>If you're eagerly awaiting your upgrade, or if this is your first iPhone, you'll be wanting to keep it safe. Smartphones tend to be with us throughout our day, and that means they can fall prey to any one of a number of hazards. Bumps, drops, even scratches from sharing your pocket with keys or coins; the list is near endless. The last thing you want is for your new phone to end up scratched, chipped, or even completely broken. Thankfully, a good protective case can stop that from happening. Here are some of the best Apple iPhone 15 cases you can buy right now.</p>Show 13 more items <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><h2 id=h-EPguwJ6pAk class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=EPguwJ6pAk>Spigen Ultra Hybrid Clear Case</h2><h3>The best clear iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Completely clear</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Good hybrid protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Slim and lightweight</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Can still yellow as it ages</li></ul><p>The iPhone 15 has a fun, vibrant color scheme, so why hide that behind chunky plastic? Spigen's Ultra Hybrid case is completely clear, which means your chosen color can shine through, while the good hybrid build means you don't sacrifice protection for choosing clarity. It's made from a hard polycarbonate (PC) frame with a TPU bumper, which means good strength across the board.</p><p>While it won't be as protective as bigger, more rugged cases, it's more than good enough for everyday protection. It can fall prey to the usual pitfalls for clear cases though, specifically the yellowing of TPU as it ages. Spigen has given it an anti-yellowing coating though, which should help to slow the process down. It's available at a great price, offers good durability, and is completely clear. The Spigen Ultra Hybrid is a great case.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/22/338661c61bc34edd8a579c0ab13f50bff6347411.jpeg alt="Spigen Ultra Hybrid Designed for iPhone 15 Case (2023), [Anti-Yellowing] [Military-Grade Protection] - Crystal Clear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Spigen Ultra Hybrid Clear Case The best clear iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-oDnn05lUd4 class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=oDnn05lUd4>Ringke Fusion-X case</h2><h3>The best slim iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Strong hybrid design</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Slim and lightweight</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>QuikCatch lanyard attachments</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Unique style may not be for everyone</li></ul><p>It's a strange looking case, but it's also a very effective one. Ringke's Fusion-X case is a mainstay of our case round-ups for a number of very good reasons, and it's because it's lightweight, protective, and also comes with some useful features you don't find in many other cases.</p><p>This is a hybrid case, meaning it's made from a blend of soft TPU and hard polycarbonate, giving it a broad range of protective qualities that will protect it from bumps, drops, and scratches. The really unique feature are the three QuikCatch lanyard holes in the sides of the case. You can use these points to attach a wrist or shoulder strap, and further reduce the chances of a catastrophic drop disabling your device — a real must-buy for the clumsy among us.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/4/0488033759347e1c81ed0cb95276ee48c9d6a34c.jpeg alt="Ringke Fusion-X case for the iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Ringke Fusion-X case The best slim iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-Br7KD5lgTH class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=Br7KD5lgTH>Speck Presidio2 ClickLock Cases</h2><h3>The best accessorizing iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Exclusive ClickLock accessories</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Many styles available</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Anti-microbial protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Drop protection up to 13 feet</li></ul><p>These days, a case shouldn’t just be a case. You carry your iPhone everywhere you go, so in addition to protecting your expensive investment, the case should also offer some practicality. Cue the Speck ClickLock Presidio 2 and Presidio Perfect-Clear cases for the four 2023 iPhone models. It includes patent-pending ClickLock technology with a no-slip interlock for MagSafe accessories.

It’s a welcome enhancement that keeps the related accessories securely connected to the back of the case, with no slippage and no unwanted detachments.</p><p>Compatible ClickLock accessories include a hands-free car vent phone mount, an attachable wallet, and a 360-degree adjustable finger grip with a kickstand. Isn’t it about time your iPhone case did more for you? There are 169 new cases from Speck in 17 designs and 20 custom colors. Of those, 57 include Speck’s ClickLock interlocking technology.

The SolidSuit is made from ShockSpread ECO, a TPE material that's been crafted from sustainable (i.e. recycled) plastics, so it's eco-conscious as well as protective.</p><p>RhinoShield boast that it doesn't feel plasticy, but still offers a strong grip, great durability, and it's even easy-to-clean. Yes, it's not a great looking case, but the different colorways on offer do help that a lot.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/4/a4a6757495367023777dec340236227ed11892d6.jpeg alt="RhinoShield SolidSuit Protective Case for the iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> RhinoShield SolidSuit Protective Case The best protective iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-5HCcOF3d6c class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=5HCcOF3d6c>Torro Leather Bumper Case</h2><h3>The best leather iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>High quality leather</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>MagSafe compatible</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Advanced protection</li></ul><p>It's common to assume a leather case is a wallet case, but that's not always true. This Torro case isn't a full leather option, but it uses top grain U.S. leather to create a luxurious leather backplate on a protective bumper.</p><p>The bumper has Torro's GEO-AS-3 technology, a series of geometric air holes which help to absorb shock, and when combined with the inner microfibre coating, help to keep your phone safe and scratch-free. It's fully compatible with MagSafe, and while it's on the expensive side for a case, this isn't a bad price for premium leather and good protection.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/8/aff8b47d480dd8d90998981c2cef257222e0cd36.jpeg alt="Torro Leather Bumper Case for the Apple iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Torro Leather Bumper Case The best leather iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-bK89Fuvp95 class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=bK89Fuvp95>Mous Clarity 2.0 Case</h2><h3>Best drop-proof iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Gorgeous clear or iridescent colorways</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Strong drop protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Slim and lightweight</li></ul><p>You likely know Mous from its long-running video campaign showing its cases being dropped from ladders, out of windows, and even off buildings. Mous set out to create protective cases with ludicrously effective drop-proofing, and it largely succeeded in that goal.</p><p>While no case is truly proof against damage, Mous's cases are one of the best to get if the idea of dropping your phone breaks you out in a cold sweat. It's fully MagSafe compatible, has two lanyard attachment points, and has some lovely colorway options, including the stunning iridescent option. It's certainly on the more expensive side, though surely any price is worth keeping your shiny new iPhone 15 safe, right?</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/4/3ebad42cfa00a8f77a5ed4e430fa570bc1d848ab.jpeg alt="Mous Clarity 2.0 Case for the iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Mous Clarity 2.0 Case Best drop-proof iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-ssppcZbN5s class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=ssppcZbN5s>Blackbrook Leather 2-in-1 Wallet Case</h2><h3>The best luxury wallet iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>High quality leather case</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Detachable wallet section</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>RFID protection</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Very expensive</li></ul><p>The iPhone 15 may not be at the top of the iPhone pile any more (that's the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max), but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve some real luxury. Blackbrook's leather wallet cases come in a number of forms, but this is one of the more high-end and useful versions.</p><p>The case section is made entirely from premium full-grain leather that ages gracefully and gives a super-soft and smooth feel in the hand. Strong magnets attach it to the wallet section, giving you the option to leave your wallet at home and carry payment cards with your phone. It also morphs into a stand, if needed. A great case with a lot to offer.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/4/9de0cd5f154ec0e1f39b4ad8ecf92cd26ce5a581.jpeg alt="Blackbrook Leather Wallet Case for the iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Blackbrook Leather 2-in-1 Wallet Case The best luxury wallet iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-dNN2qaerql class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=dNN2qaerql>OtterBox Commuter Rugged Case</h2><h3>The best rugged iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Strong rugged protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Slim and lightweight</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Exceed military standards by three-times</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Boring design</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Expensive</li></ul><p>OtterBox is the first place you look when you want a rugged case, and the Commuter series is its everyday case that still packs serious protective credentials. The hybrid dual-layer construction is made from a mix of 35% recycled rubber with a rigid outer shell. OtterBox loves to exceed expectations, so it's rated to withstand three-times the military standards for drop-protection.</p><p>In short, it's protective and rugged, but since it's the everyday version of OtterBox's case range, it's also slim and lightweight, giving you the best of both worlds. It's on the expensive side, as are most of OtterBox's offerings, and it's a bit boring to look at. But if you want something protective, the OtterBox Commuter is for you.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/22/8e8700bf30e75d573881663a9288dd3029bdc8f1.jpeg alt="OtterBox iPhone 15, iPhone 14, and iPhone 13 Commuter Series Case - BLACK, slim & tough, pocket-friendly, with port protection" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> OtterBox Commuter Rugged Case The best rugged iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-eqYzSnJOiq class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=eqYzSnJOiq>Ghostek Nautical Waterproof Case</h2><h3>The best waterproof iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Strong rugged protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Clear back</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>IP68-rated waterproofing</li></ul><p><a href=#>The iPhone 15 is waterproof</a>, but if you're taking your iPhone near a pool, the sea, or anywhere with deep water, you may want to make sure your precious phone is extra protected against the destructive power of water. That's where a waterproof case comes in extra handy, and Ghostek has made a name for itself by creating waterproof cases you can rely on.</p><p>It can withstand water ingress for up to six feet deep for up to 90 minutes, protection enabled by its watertight port seals. It's not lacking in protection elsewhere either, with drop resistance up to an incredible 12 feet, raised edges for the camera lenses, and a shockproof construction. It's an expensive case for sure, but considering the amount of protection this offers, it's worth the expense.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/9/22/83d6fa5dbe67c711176a7deda1ede654b7049917.jpeg alt="Ghostek Nautical Slim Waterproof Case for Apple iPhone 15 - Built-in Screen & Camera Lens Protector, Compatible with MagSafe (6.1 Inch, Clear)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Ghostek Nautical Waterproof Case The best waterproof iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-HCy4QkhVO2 class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=HCy4QkhVO2>Snakehive Leather Wallet for iPhone 15</h2><h3>The best vintage wallet iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Made from handcrafted leather in multiple colors</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Can hold up to three cards and some cash</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Reasonably priced</li></ul><p>For an elegant and stylish wallet case that won't break the bank, Snakehive offers an impressive pick in its Vintage Leather Wallet. While it may not be as luxurious as pricier designer cases, it's still handcrafted from different cuts of top-grain nubuck leather and hand-dyed so that each case has a unique look and a great leather feel that will age into a rich patina over time. In addition to traditional chestnut brown and basic black leather colors, its also available in navy, teal, plum, and bottle green finishes that run from a soft, suede-like feel to more glossy and smooth.</p><p>Inside, durable pigskin leather keeps your iPhone 15 cushioned against impacts, along with a magnetic clasp to make sure the cover stays closed to protect your screen. Like most wallet cases, you'll also find room for three cards and some cash inside the front flap, and it can double as a stand to prop your iPhone 15 up in landscape orientation for movies and video calls.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/10/19/4c9119f162ff3c53ff117aabbb141478ab54ab50.jpeg alt="Snakehive Leather Wallet for iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Snakehive Leather Wallet for iPhone 15 The best vintage wallet iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-xnHHNP398d class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=xnHHNP398d>Smartish Wallet Slayer for iPhone 15</h2><h3>The best minimalist wallet iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Offers solid drop protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Holds up to three cards plus cash</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Available in fun colors and patterns</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Not compatible with wireless charging or MagSafe</li></ul><p>Someday, <a href=#>Apple Pay</a> and <a href=#>Digital IDs</a> will eliminate the need to carry any cards around with you at all, but, sadly, we're not quite there yet.

As the name suggests, this case lets you leave your wallet at home and keep your most important cards on you without bulking up your iPhone 15 and covering up the screen like most folio wallet cases do.</p><p>Instead, Wallet Slayer offers a snug compartment on the back where you can stash at least three cards and a bit of cash for easy access. It's also built tough, drop-tested for impact protection of up to six feet, thanks to air cushioned corners, plus textured sides that ensure you'll be able to keep a good grip on it. The only catch? The card compartment at the back means it's not compatible with wireless charging — including MagSafe —&nbsp;so unless you want to take the case off, you'll need plug your iPhone 15 in to charge it the old-fashioned way.

The company is known for making some of the thinnest smartphone cases on the market that, unlike cheap shell cases, still offer decent protection thanks to raised edges around the camera and strong materials.</p><p>At only 0.02 inches (0.5mm) thick, don't expect this case to do much in the way of drop protection, but it will keep your iPhone 15 looking as pristine as the day you bought it while adding almost no extra weight and ensure it still slides easily into your pocket.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/10/19/532836dfc8e7a50229759515bfb1b88d81eb670d.jpeg alt="totallee Thin iPhone 15 Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Totallee Thin Case for iPhone 15 The best lightweight iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-wLcdfUHMhJ class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=wLcdfUHMhJ>Caseology Nano Pop Mag for iPhone 15</h2><h3>The best fun and protective iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Fun two-tone color designs</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Good drop protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Comfortable silicone finish</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>May clash with some iPhone colors</li></ul><p>Caseology's Nano Pop offers a set of fun two-tone designs that complement many of the iPhone 15 colors that will still show through the camera cutout while still delivering very good drop protection and a silicone back that feels smooth and comfortable to hold onto.</p><p>The playful designs give the case a sportier look, particularly if you opt for the yellow-and-blue Blueberry Navy or the yellow-and-reddish Magenta Lychee. For those who prefer a more subtle aesthetic there's also a more muted Burgundy Bean and a classic Black Sesame that still manages to be one of the most attractive neutral designs we've ever seen. The only real downside to this otherwise great case is that you may not find a color combo that works well your preferred iPhone 15 finish.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/10/19/3e254787e58b2ea62738040cd52bc5c314aa1a06.jpeg alt="Caseology Nano Pop Mag for iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Caseology Nano Pop Mag for iPhone 15 The best fun and protective iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-hE6WyGEuWR class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=hE6WyGEuWR>Apple Silicone Case for iPhone 15</h2><h3>The best colorful iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Available in a broad selection of colors to complement the iPhone 15</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>MagSafe-compatible</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Made by Apple</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Expensive</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Only offers basic protection</li></ul><p>While it's far from the least expensive case you'll find for your iPhone 15, Apple's Silicon Case has the advantage of being made by Apple so you can be confident it will fit your iPhone like a glove and work flawlessly with MagSafe accessories.</p><p>The Apple Silicon case also has the advantage of being available in a selection of eight colors that Apple has specifically chosen to complement the iPhone 15 models that will go into it.

Since StandBy mode only kicks in when your iPhone is propped up and charging, you ideally want a case that offers MagSafe compatibility without a kickstand getting in the way.</p><p>That's where the Torras Pstand comes in. It checks all the right boxes for style and protection while also adding MagSafe support and a kickstand that's off to one side. This means you can set your iPhone 15 down at the perfect angle for StandBy mode while still magnetically attaching Apple's MagSafe Charger to the back. Torras also offers strong magnets, promising 60% stronger attraction than Apple's MagSafe cases, and a kickstand that's made with high-carbon steel hinges to withstand over 30,000 rigorous folding tests, yet folds flush into the back when you're not using it.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/10/19/ad330432ce8b7821096449f322bd62c30cfa3ab7.jpeg alt="Torras Pstand Case for iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Torras Pstand Case for iPhone 15 The best kickstand iPhone 15 case <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-aX32poDjm8 class=b-content__item-heading data-link-product-offer=aX32poDjm8>Casetify Impact Case for iPhone 15</h2><h3>The best custom iPhone 15 case</h3><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--good"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Available in dozens of cool and unique designs</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Solid impact protection</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>MagSafe compatible</li></ul><ul class="b-product-attributes__items b-product-attributes__items--bad"><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Expensive</li><li class=b-product-attributes__item>Casetify branding on camera borders</li></ul><p>While many of the most protective cases are kind of bland, Casetify's Impact goes in the opposite direction, with dozens of cool and flashy designs that will give your iPhone 15 some flair and let you express your unique style. In addition to Casetify's expansive collection of fun and whimsical creations, it also has a massive "Co-Lab" collection that lets you get a case with licensed designs from Disney, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and Star Wars, plus Peanuts, Harry Potter, The Office, BTS, and even Oreo cookies.</p><p>However, don't let all these designs fool you. As the name suggests, Casetify's Impact also provides military-grade drop protection of up to 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) while remaining surprisingly lightweight and MagSafe-compatible. The catch? They don't come cheap, but you're probably getting your money's worth if you go for one of the licensed designs.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 onerror=dti_load_error(this) data-dt-lazy-src=https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ccp-prd-s3-uploads/2023/10/19/47578a6586ea04df5c454f25f11e3ce67351cf92.jpeg alt="Casetify Impact Case for iPhone 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Casetify Impact Case for iPhone 15 The best custom iPhone 15 case<h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVforyjtcueZpudo6l6orzPpZxmoaCdvK%2BxjGpsZpuRqLK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sequence-breaking.html><span>←</span><span>Sequence breaking - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
