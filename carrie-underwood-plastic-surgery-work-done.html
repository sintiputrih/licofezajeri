"She’s still as beautiful as always but I didn’t even think this was Carrie!" one commented on how the star looks different.</p><p id=eW-_YQ0K9re data-wc=45>Other fans were quick to explain the change in Carrie's looks, writing: "That's what 17 stitches from a fall do to you. Makes you look a little different," while another commented: "She’s also older. Do you look the same as you did five years ago?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/06eff40e4080-carrie-underwood-shorts.jpg><p id=eQvjaheHcWG data-wc=35>Indeed, Carrie had to have a lot of work done on her face<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;following a fall in 2018</a>. In a statement at the time, Carrie said she had: "40 and 50 stitches," to her face.</p><p id=eNvq5hDCavz data-wc=25>Carrie fell on the steps of her house and later warned her followers that she may look "a bit different" when they saw her again.</p><p id=eogzg7FdXJr data-wc=26>"Even though I’ve had the best people helping me, I'm still healing and not quite looking the same," she told her fan club in January 2018.</p><p id=eFJc64tk2cA data-wc=28>"I honestly don't know how things are going to end up but I do know this: I am grateful. I am grateful that it wasn't much, much worse."</p><p id=ePhLp08UCm2 data-wc=40>Fans did note that her accident was a while ago, and with Carrie looking fresh-faced and beautiful, we turned to aesthetic doctor Dr. Sabina Hanoman-Singh, of the <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CREO Clinic</a> for her professional opinion on the plastic surgery Carrie has had.</p><h2><strong>What surgery has Carrie Underwood had?</strong></h2><p id=ellH-XeUkqz data-wc=42>"Carrie Underwood looks great and whilst we don’t know if she has had any treatments to enhance her looks, it looks as though she may have chosen some anti-aging and natural enhancement procedures to maintain her youthful look gracefully," confirms Dr. Sabina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d0ab0d7a3d54-carrieunderwood-before-after.jpg><p id=e-07-hGYHZa data-wc=53>"Starting with her upper face, she may have had anti-wrinkle injections. These injections can smooth out forehead lines, frown lines, and crow's feet while also preventing new wrinkles. They can give the forehead a smooth and fresh appearance and subtly lift the eyebrows, as you can see in her photos," Dr. Sabina says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f5cfd70c9171-gettyimages-1390948200.jpg><h2><strong>Carrie Underwood's bright eyes</strong></h2><p id=eb-IkGvKrXhN data-wc=43>"Carrie's eyes, both upper and lower, seem smoother and firmer, which could be a result of collagen synthesis treatments. These treatments might include things skin boosters that provide essential building blocks for collagen, antioxidants for brightness, and hyaluronic acid for hydration and plumpness.</p><p id=eubb23GNrMUt data-wc=50>"She might have also tried other treatments such as laser therapy or regenerative treatments such as polynucleotides to stimulate her skin to produce more collagen and elastin. Often, a combination of these treatments works best to make the skin plumper, smoother, and tighter," Dr. Sabina says of Carrie's youthful looks.</p><p id=evP-gFvLCD data-wc=12><strong>REVEALED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Carrie Underwood uses this game-changing $16 face cream for flawless skin</a></strong></p><p id=etf9VNbAa9wq data-wc=42>"The lines around Carrie's nose and mouth appear less noticeable, which can happen with a mix of treatments. Some involve filling lost volume with dermal fillers made from hyaluronic acid, while others focus on tightening with collagen synthesis treatments like laser therapy."</p><h2><strong>Has Carrie Underwood had lip filler?</strong></h2><p id=egZu9hACPu3a data-wc=42>"Carrie's lips look hydrated and plump, which might be from dermal filler treatments using hyaluronic acid gel. Her smile also shows less gum, possibly because of anti-wrinkle injections around her mouth, which can reduce the muscles' pull when smiling," explains Dr. Sabina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d49aa8f556f-carrie-underwood.jpg><p id=e0GPA9UIv-o data-wc=10><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lip flip: The 30-second tweakment for fuller, poutier lips</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Has Carrie Underwood had anti-wrinkle injections?</strong></h2><p id=e5Q-rZ7Gp4rJ data-wc=49>Dr. Sabina continues that Carrie's lower face and jawline maintain a youthful shape, perhaps due to the collagen synthesis treatments mentioned earlier. "Anti-wrinkle injections in the lower face could also help by preventing sagging in the mouth corners, jawline, and neck muscles, giving her a lifted and refreshed appearance."</p><p id=eAixwje9Bp data-wc=10><span>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Learn how to be happier with our HELLO!
