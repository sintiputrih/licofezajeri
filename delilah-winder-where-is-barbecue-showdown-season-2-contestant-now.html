If you are one of Delilah’s many fans and are eager to learn about her current whereabouts, we have your back!</p><h2>Delilah Winder’s Barbecue Showdown Journey</h2><p>Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Delilah became a beloved contestant and was called Auntie Delilah by many contestants and judges. From the show’s start, the culinary expert showcased how well she could cook. For the first four challenges, Delilah’s food was well-appreciated by the judges. She was often mentioned honorably by the judges for her performance, though she did not win any challenges outright.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=717154 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/thyron-mathews-where-is-barbecue-showdown-season-2-winner-now/barbecue-showdown-2023-3/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/T2-1.jpg data-orig-size=1200,675 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"Courtesy of netflix","camera":"","caption":"Barbecue Showdown.

Both she and Michelle Lundstorm were in the bottom two. However, neither of the ladies was eliminated and progressed to the next round. <a href=#>Thyron “Big T” Mathews</a> partnered with <a href=#>Logan Sandoval</a> in the sixth round. This meant that Delilah and Michelle had to work together to present a delicious meal to the judges. With the gentlemen winning the competition, the duo was in the bottom two, leading to Michelle’s elimination.</p><p>With only one round away from being a finalist, Delilah gave it her all to prepare a family-style meal cooked over an open fire using skewers. Unfortunately, she was eliminated and could not make it to the next round. Yet, that does not mean Delilah was absent from the finale, as she returned and assisted Thyron in cooking his final dish. Thanks to the effort put in by the two, he won the competition and was pretty thankful for her help.</p><h2>Where is Delilah Winder Now?</h2><p>It seems like Delilah prefers to keep the details of her personal life private. That said, she is pretty proud of her professional accomplishments, which have helped her earn much respect from others. Delilah is the chef of her brand, Chef Delilah, which started in May 2000. Through this venture, she offers her services as a Personal Chef. No matter the requirement or restriction in one’s diet, she endeavors to fulfill all needs and provide her clients with fresh, home-cooked meals. In addition, the Netflix star has a restaurant called Delilah’s Everyday Soul in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/T2-1.jpg><p>Not just that, Delilah is the Lead Chef Consultant for the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association in Pennsylvania’s Greater Philadelphia Area. She has been in the position since January 2003. The Atlanta native is also the author of ‘Delilah’s Everyday Soul: Southern Cooking With Style,’ published in 2006.
