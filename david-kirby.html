In its 20th anniversary retrospective on the photo, TIME estimated that more than 1 billion people have seen David Kirby’s last photo.</p><p>The exposure was not all positive, however. Right away, Catholic groups, in a rare foray into functional aesthetics, complained about the composition of the photograph. The way Kirby’s father cradles his head, they argued, is blasphemously close to a very common motif in European Christian art called the Pieta, in which the grieving Virgin Mary cradles her dead son Jesus after his descent from the cross.</p><p>Other criticism came from gay and HIV/AIDS activist circles when a colorized version of the picture was used in Benetton’s 1992 “United Colors of Benetton” campaign. As it happened, the family had given the company permission to use the photo as a way of spreading the image to more people than would otherwise have seen it.</p><h2>In The End</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-113601 alt="David Kirby Photo" width=900 height=552 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/face-aids-peta-hospice.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-113601 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Therese Frare</span><span class=caption-body>Peta lies in bed in the Pater Noster Hospice, where he had spent countless hours as a volunteer caregiver.</span></p><p>After David Kirby’s death, many of the people involved with the photo stayed in touch. Frare eventually moved to Seattle and found work as a freelance journalist. Peta, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the half-Sioux, half-white, transgendered caretaker</a> who had brought Frare into the hospice, continued working with dying AIDS patients until his own condition worsened in 1991.</p><p>Frare took several photos of Peta during his decline, and when he could no longer look after himself, the Kirby family took care of Peta — out of gratitude and love for how he had cared for their son. Peta died of AIDS-related illness in 1992.</p><p>For more on the stories behind iconic photos after this look at David Kirby, check out who the famed <a href=#>“Migrant Mother”</a> truly was, and how <a href=#>photojournalism ultimately cost Kevin Carter his life</a>.
