I’d been using my cast-iron skillet as a DIY tofu press for years, but I often hear from readers about how much they love their tofu presses, and I thought it would be fun to try one out. I decided to experiment with some of the best tofu presses on the market to see how I liked them.</p><p>…and I’m a tofu press convert! Tofu presses are simple gadgets that remove the excess moisture from tofu. They evenly apply pressure to the tofu, squeezing out the water that can make it soft or crumbly without squishing it. After pressing, the tofu has a firmer, chewier texture. It holds its shape when you make <a href=#>grilled tofu</a>, and it crisps up perfectly when you make <a href=#>air fryer tofu</a> or <a href=#>baked tofu</a>. Now that I have a tofu press in my kitchen, I’m never going back!</p><p>You’ll find my picks for the best tofu presses below. If you cook tofu often, I definitely recommend investing in one. They come in a variety of sizes and styles, so check them out to find the best tofu press for you!</p><h2>Our Top Picks:</h2><li><strong>What’s in My Kitchen:</strong> Tofuture Tofu Press – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25.95 at Amazon</a></li><li><strong>My Other Favorite:</strong> TofuBud Tofu Press – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24.25 at Amazon</a></li><li><strong>Best Basic Tofu Press:</strong> EZ Tofu Press – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$21.99 at Amazon</a></li><li><strong>Best Bamboo Tofu Press:</strong> ToPress Bamboo Tofu Press – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22.49 at Amazon</a></li><h2>Reviews of The Best Tofu Presses</h2><h2>1.

The Tofuture Tofu Press was my favorite for a few reasons. I love that it’s small and compact, with just 3 pieces(!), so it’s easy to store. It’s also really simple to use. It consists of an inner container where you put the tofu, an outer container that catches the liquid, and a lid that presses down on the tofu block. You secure the lid to the containers with silicone bands, and you can choose from three levels of force. Each one yields perfect, evenly pressed tofu every time. This press is my new go-to tool for pressing tofu!</p><p>I also like how the excess water contains itself within the press, so there’s no mess to clean up afterwards. I just dump the liquid into the sink!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25.95 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 6 by 5 by 2.8 inches</li><li>Weight: 0.1 kilogram</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Dishwasher Safe: Yes</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Easy to use</li><li>Built-in drainage plate</li><li>Easy to clean</li><li>Made with BPA-free materials</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Only comes in one color option</li><li>Bands could pop off</li></ul><p><strong>What Others are Saying:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Best Products</a> found the Tofuture Tofu press to be the best overall, and it was reviewed by <a href=# rel=noopener>The Kitchn</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Insider</a> as a great pick for tofu presses.

It presses tofu evenly and quickly, and it contains the liquid from the tofu–a huge plus! It features two pressure levels, which are controlled by a sturdy spring. Though this press is easy to use overall, I initially had a little trouble twisting the spring into place, which is why I ranked it below the Tofuture press. All in all, though, it’s still a great pick!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24.25 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 4.7 by 5.5 by 4.7 inches</li><li>Weight: 1 pound</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Dishwasher Safe: Yes</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Presses in as little as 20 minutes</li><li>Easy to clean</li><li>Built-in drainage plate</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Larger to store than Tofuture press</li><li>Spring mechanism can be hard to twist</li></ul><p><strong>What Others are Saying:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Reviewed</a> named it one of the best tofu presses, and it has a 4.7-star rating from more than 2,500 Amazon reviews.</p><p><strong>Buy the TofuBud Tofu Press:</strong></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24.25 at Amazon</a><h2>3.

The wooden material also makes the ToPress Bamboo Tofu Press a little more aesthetically pleasing than plastic presses. It features three main pieces—a top plate, a drainage tray, and a drip tray—which are connected with screw knobs you turn to press the tofu.</p><p>Downsides of this press are that you have to adjust the knobs every so often to fully drain the tofu and that the tofu can crack if you press it too much too quickly. In addition, it leaves some indents on the tofu after pressing. But overall, I like that it catches the excess liquid, and I think it’s a great pick for someone who wants to avoid plastic.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22.49 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 8.6 by 3.9 by 0.5 inches</li><li>Weight: 1.92 pounds</li><li>Material: Bamboo</li><li>Dishwasher Safe: Yes</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Hassle-free setup and use</li><li>Can be used on varying sizes of tofu blocks</li><li>Built-in drainage plate</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Leaves indents on tofu</li><li>Better to hand wash it to not damage wood</li><li>No set pressure levels</li></ul><p><strong>What Others are Saying:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Spruce Eats</a> named it the best bamboo tofu press and Delish made it the runner-up in their list of the best tofu presses.</p><p><strong>Buy the ToPress Bamboo Tofu Press:</strong></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22.49 at Amazon</a><h2>4.

The simple plastic press is equipped with tightening knobs to press tofu blocks easily and efficiently. Once the tofu is secure in the press, I recommend setting it on its side over a bowl to capture the liquid. You’ll also need to tighten the knobs every few minutes to press out every last drop. (If you tighten it too much too quickly, the tofu can crack.) Though this press requires a bit more work, it’s still effective!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$21.99 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Size: 9 by 5.25 by 4 inches</li><li>Weight: 1.1 pounds</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Dishwasher Safe: Yes</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Made in the U.S.</li><li>Made of BPA-free plastic</li><li>Easy to clean</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Need to continue to tighten screws while it presses</li><li>No set pressure levels</li><li>Requires a separate bowl to capture liquid</li></ul><p><strong>What Others are Saying:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Spruce Eats</a> named the EZ Tofu Press the best overall tofu press.

That means that it’s heavier and more expensive than others, which is why it wasn’t one of my top picks. But if you’re willing to splurge, this may be a great non-plastic choice. You can also use it to make your own tofu! <strong>The Raw Rutes Tofu Press is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $105</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Healthy Express Extra Firm Tofu Press</strong></a></p><p>Much like the EZ Tofu Press, the Healthy Express Extra Firm Tofu Press features a top and bottom plate assisted by spring-clad screws to easily get all that liquid out of your blocks. It has a slightly curved design that might press the blocks a little better, though you will need to place it over a container on its side for the water to drain out. <strong>The Healthy Express Extra Firm Tofu Press is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $19.95</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Tofudee Tofu Press With Auto IntelliSpring</strong></a></p><p>This might be the prettiest tofu press on this list! It comes in lime and grapefruit hues to add a pop of color to your kitchen. Looks aside, I like that this plastic tofu press automatically drains the liquid into a separate container. <strong>The Tofudee Tofu Press With Auto IntelliSpring is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $25.95</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>NOYA Adjustable Tofu Press</strong></a></p><p>The NOYA Adjustable Tofu Press is popular among media sites and has been named the best overall tofu press by Reviewed and Delish. It’s not among my favorites because it’s clunkier to store, but it can double as a tofu marinating dish, giving it more than one function. <strong>The NOYA Adjustable Tofu Press is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $22.99</a>.</strong></p><h2>How I Tested The Best Tofu Presses</h2><h2><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-tofu-presses/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-tofu-press-1.jpg&description=The+4+Best+Tofu+Presses+of+2024")'></span></span></h2><p>I selected eight tofu presses that have received great reviews online and that have been personally recommended to me. I pressed multiple blocks of tofu with each of my picks. Then, I <a href=#>grilled</a>, <a href=#>baked</a>, and tasted the tofu that had been pressed in each press. I found some clear favorites in terms of ease of use and texture. My #1 choice, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tofuture Tofu Press</a>, has become a game-changer for making vegan and plant-based recipes in my kitchen!</p><h2>Everything to Know Before Buying a Tofu Press</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-tofu-presses/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/grilled-tofu.jpg&description=These+vegan+grilled+tofu+steaks+are+a+delicious%2C+easy+summer+dinner%21+They%27re+satisfying%2C+flavorful%2C+and+perfectly+charred.")'></span></span></p><h2>What to Consider Before Buying a Tofu Press</h2><p>Not all tofu presses are created equal! Some have built-in drainage plates and drip trays, while others only consist of two pieces of plastic held together with screws and bolts. Before picking one, consider the size of the tofu press–do you have room to store it? You should also consider the material (plastic, bamboo, or stainless steel), whether or not the press comes with its own drainage container, and how easy it is to wash. With these features in mind, you can chose the tofu press that will work best for you.</p><h2>Why Do You Need to Press Tofu?</h2><p>When you buy tofu, you’ll notice that it’s usually sitting in a LOT of water. Some recipes only require you to wipe off this liquid with paper towels, but if you’re <a href=#>grilling</a>, or if you want to make really crispy tofu in the <a href=#>air fryer</a> or <a href=#>oven</a>, you should squeeze most of it out. It might seem like a tedious extra step, but it will give your tofu a much more satisfying texture. Plus, pressing helps tofu <a href=# rel=noopener>soak up a marinade</a> for the best flavor!</p><h2>How Long Should You Press Tofu?</h2><p>The amount of time you need to press tofu depends on the size of the block. For reference, I usually press a 12- to 14-ounce block for about 30 minutes. If you plan ahead, you can also place it in a press and pop it in the fridge overnight. That way, you won’t be scrambling to press it right before you start cooking.</p><h2>Can You Press Tofu Without a Tofu Press?</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-tofu-presses/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_4736.jpg&description=The+4+Best+Tofu+Presses+of+2024")'></span></span></p><p>A tofu press makes pressing tofu super easy and convenient, but it’s still possible to press without one. To do this, I use a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cast iron skillet</a>. Pat the tofu dry and wrap it in a kitchen towel. Set it on a cutting board or baking sheet and place a heavy cast iron pan on top. Set it aside for about 30 minutes, checking halfway through and changing the towel if it’s too wet. That’s it! If you enjoy tofu pressed with a cast-iron skillet, I definitely recommend getting a tofu press. It makes pressing tofu even simpler!</p><h2>The Best Tofu Recipes</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-tofu-presses/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tofu.jpg&description=The+4+Best+Tofu+Presses+of+2024")'></span></span></p><p>Once you have a tofu press, I hope you start adding tofu to your regular rotation!
