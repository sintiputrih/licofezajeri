<a href=../../../iran-teen-drama-summer-with-hope-wins-karlovy-vary-film-festival.html></a>
Iran-set coming-of-age story “Summer With Hope” won the top prize at the 56th Karlovy Vary Intl. Film Festival, winning over the Crystal Globe jury with its story of youthful competitive swimmer Omid as he struggles to train for a risky ocean competition.
The film, directed and written by Iranian-Canadian Sadaf Foroughi, is her sophomore feature, following up on 2017 teen drama “Ava.” The Karlovy Vary prize comes with $25,000.
The brisk yet redolent Spanish study of friends “You Have to Come and See It,” directed by Jonás Trueba, won the special jury prize and $15,000 for its ironic, philosophical portrayal of a country outing by Madrid city folk.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jane the Virgins Biggest Plot Twists, Ranked</h2><time>Jan 13, 2024</time>

As Jane the Virgin comes to an end, it’s time to reflect on the gifts the CW’s little dramedy-that-could bestowed upon us, including but certainly not limited to: a simultaneously smart and earnest look at a multigenerational family, a celebration of love in all forms, Rogelio De La Vega, Gina Rodriguez’s seven-minute monologue, the treasure that is Jane and Petra’s friendship, a Pavlovian response in which you cry every time you see a porch swing, and, holy hell, some of the greatest plot twists in the game.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Keith Gill Net Worth | How Rich Is He | Explore His Financial Success Story</h2><time>Jan 13, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../keith-gill-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-explore-his-financial-success-story.html></a>
Few financial stories have captivated audiences as much as Keith Gill’s, the “Dumb Money” star’s. Keith rose to popularity during a massive GameStop short squeeze in 2021, which increased his initial $53,000 investment to roughly $48 million at its peak.
Despite the publicity, Keith Gill’s net worth is unknown, particularly in 2024, with several estimates estimating it at $30 million, a figure that should be approached with caution. Gill’s amazing rise from financial analyst to investment phenomenon has spurred several conversations and suspicions regarding his fortune, highlighting the unpredictable fortunes and dynamic nature of financial markets.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Keshia Knight Pulliam Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography</h2><time>Jan 13, 2024</time>

King Charles and Queen Camilla decided to break with tradition for the royal coronation which took place on 6 May as the Queen's grandchildren – who have been largely kept out of the spotlight – were included in the Westminster Abbey service.
The decision sends a strong message of unity and highlights the couple's blended family; both have been divorced and both have step-children.

<a href=../../../microsoft-surface-book-2015-review.html></a>
Battery Life I would say the average Ultrabook has around 50 Wh of battery capacity. Some have a bit more, and some have a bit less, but 50 Wh would be a good ballpark figure. The Surface Book has a 70 Wh battery, split into 18 Wh in the Clipboard, and 52 Wh in the base. Combined, it gives the Surface Book more battery capacity than any other Ultrabook. However, as I’ve just discussed in the display section, Microsoft has a high resolution panel that is also based on a traditional amorphous silicon TFT which may impact the battery life.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Father Matt Williams, Mother Erika Monroe</h2><time>Jan 12, 2024</time>
