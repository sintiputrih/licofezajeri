<a href=../../../dell-updates-ultrabook-thin-m3800-mobile-workstation-with-4k-display.html></a>
Today Dell is taking the wraps off of an updated version of the M3800 mobile workstation which first launched in November 2013. This is the first thin and light mobile workstation, with a thickness of just 0.31” - 0.71” (8 mm – 18 mm) and a much lighter weight than other mobile workstations at that time. The 15.6” model has a starting weight of just 4.15 lbs, or 1.88 kg. That’s not light compared to an ultrabook, but it is in good company for other devices with a full quad-core CPU and a Quadro GPU onboard.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fire Emblem Engage: how to get the Silver Card</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>

However, it isn't clear how to actually get it, and missing it initially could require a bit of effort to go back and get it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Getting Inside the new Xbox 360</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>
<a href=../../../welcome-to-valhalla-inside-the-new-250gb-xbox-360-slim.html></a>
To get into the Xbox 360 you’ll need pretty much the same tools you needed to get into the old one. A flat head screwdriver helps, preferably one with a long, thin stem (a tiny flathead is also useful in getting the heatsink clamp off if you want to go that far). You’ll need a torx driver with T8 bit. A phillips head screwdriver if you want to remove the fan on the heatsink and a selection of thin/flat tools to help you pry bits of the case apart.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/175/>← Prev Page</a>
