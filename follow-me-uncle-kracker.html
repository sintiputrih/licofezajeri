Released on February 20, 2001, the song was included on his debut album Double Wide (2000), released in the same year. <strong>Uncle Kracker</strong> and American musician <strong>Michael Bradford&nbsp;</strong>co-penned the song. A good&nbsp;friend, American singer-songwriter, rapper, record producer <strong>Kid Rock</strong>, together with <strong>Michael Bradford</strong> produced the song. This three-minute song was released by the Lava Records Label, which is currently owned by Republic Records/Universal Music Group.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>Song Interpretation</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>The best part about country songs is their ability to contain meaningful messages and convey it through their lyrics. The songs of Uncle Kracker are just an example of this. However, his song,&nbsp;“<strong>Follow Me</strong>“, has been disputed to have different meanings as interpreted by music critics. More music critics, more points of view!</p><p style=text-align:justify>To note, the most popular and easily understood interpretation of the song based on its lyrics is its reference to drugs and/or extramarital sex. Since its release in 2001, music fans have argued the main point of the song. In addition, it has also received mixed views and reactions from audience and internet users alike. To clarify these arguments that bound the internet, Uncle Kracker affirmed and revealed in a 2007 interview the real reference of the song (from the songwriters POV):</p><p style=text-align:center><span style=color:#930;font-size:20px>“It takes on a couple of different meanings. I’ve heard some people think that I’m talking about drugs, or some people think I’m talking about cheating. I guess it’s kinda both. I would never want to say anything that would get myself in trouble, being married with a couple of kids. That song is like a dirty picture painted with a pretty brush.”</span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>Song Chart Performance</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>Since its debut release in 2001,&nbsp;“<strong>Follow Me</strong>” continued to enter different music charts in the U.S. and in foreign countries until 2016. As a matter of fact, it was a chart-topper in more than 17 countries.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Furthermore, the song was popular that it went no. 1 on eight music charts namely in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, Sweden, and the U.S. On the other hand,&nbsp;“<strong>Follow Me</strong>” penetrated other countries like Belgium, Canada, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the U.K. Overall, the song was truly a certified worldwide hit and so far, it is Uncle Kracker’s highest charting single release to date.</p><p>Here’s a part of the popular hit:</p><p class=UH8R2 style=text-align:center><strong>All you know is when I’m with you</strong><br><strong>I make you free</strong><br><strong>And swim through your veins</strong><br><strong>Like a fish in the sea</strong></p><p class=UH8R2 style=text-align:center><strong>I’m singin’</strong><br><strong>Follow me</strong><br><strong>Everything is all right</strong><br><strong>I’ll be the one to tuck you in at night</strong><br><strong>And if you want to leave I can guarantee</strong><br><strong>You won’t find nobody else like me</strong></p><p class=UH8R2 style=text-align:center><strong>I’m not worried</strong><br><strong>‘Bout the ring you wear</strong><br><strong>‘Cause as long as no one knows</strong><br><strong>Then nobody can care</strong></p><h3 style=text-align:justify>Watch the first single and first no. 1 song by Uncle Kracker, “Follow Me” below:</h3><p></p><p style=text-align:center><span style=font-size:20px>Any thoughts folks?
