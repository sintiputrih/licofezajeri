Larson responds, “well I’m Brie…” to which Hamm replies, “yeah, I’m John.” After both actors finally get on board with what is going on, they seem to very casually accept the fact that they are dinner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=true>After adding in the extremely obvious praise of the product, “with Hellmans, all these leftovers can be anything” spoken by Hamm, the fridge door then opens to reveal a giant Davidson staring in at them like something from Attack on Titans. The comedian tells them with just a little too much glee, “I’m gonna eat you guys.” Luckily that’s as close as we get to the cannibalistic undertones of the commercial as we cut to an actual brie and ham toastie being made with the condiment.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=false>As he tucks into the toastie at the party (who stops to make a toastie at a party?) he tells the, now full-sized Larson and Hamm, “you guys are really delicious” to which Hamm responds, “That’s, that’s weird.” Yep, that is kind of the tone of the whole piece though now we have gotten it out of the way maybe the name/food jokes for these two actors will finally be over. It’s been done.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S9psDEZpuarpmZwLC6jJ6Yratdl7%2BqsYylmKurn6N6orrDZqGopl2drq65jKKlZqCVobmurc2sZKytoJq%2Fbq7OsKNmm5%2Biuqa%2BwqKYpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katheryn-winnick-net-worth-159781.html><span>←</span><span>Katheryn Winnick Net Worth</span></a>
