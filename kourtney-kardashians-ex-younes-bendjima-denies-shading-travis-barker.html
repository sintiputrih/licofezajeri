Keep me far way from all that. Much appreciated. Gracias amigos.”</p><p>Kardashian and Bendjima <a href=#>dated on and off</a> from 2016 until <a href=#>they split for good in early 2020</a>. During a recent episode of KUWTK, the Poosh founder was questioned by sister <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> about her ex.</p><p>“No, never,” Kourtney replied when Khloé, 36, asked whether she still talks to Bendjima. “He’ll text me once in a while. … I’m feeling really content with my own way of life.”</p><p>Kourtney, who has been publicly seeing Barker since January, <a href=#>added that her ex was “a little negative”</a> during their romance.</p><p>While the Good American cofounder didn’t mention Bendjima by name, Khloé later confirmed via Twitter that she was referring to him on the March episode.</p><p>“He was sooooooo toxic and negative for Kourt #KUWTK,” she tweeted.
