I said, 'Absolutely! It would be nice to see you doing something other than watching YouTube or going to [expletive] Lululemon every [expletive] weekend.'"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9b621c0044dd-adam-sandler-daughters-sunny-sadie.jpg><p id=e1CuIrcRzn data-wc=21>He then went on to read the speech they had created for him which included many amusing jibes at their dad.&nbsp;</p><p id=eB8joR8Pm2 data-wc=61>At one point they poked fun at his awards shelf by saying: "It means a lot to him seeing how most of the awards on his trophy shelf are shaped like popcorn buckets, blimps or fake mini Oscars that say 'Father of the Year,' which he sadly purchased himself while wandering in a self-pitying fog through the headshops of Times Square."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eac8351f97df-gettyimages-1477905772.jpg><p id=eynvcz4ik- data-wc=30>All joking aside, Adam adores being a dad. He and Jackie have kept their family life mostly out of the spotlight but he has spoken about parenthood in the past.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewIF21sL9P data-wc=57>When his children were younger, Adam told People: "My kids give me the most joy, but there are life adjustments. I don’t go out to meet anyone after 9:30 at night. I eat dinner at 6 or 7. If someone makes me stay out until 10:30 at night, I’m angry the entire next day because I’m exhausted."</p><p id=eXdjaszI-Y data-wc=22>Both Sunny and Sadie have made cameos in Adam's movies, but they don't have quite the passion for acting as he does.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1974c5809cdf-gettyimages-1469842100.jpg><p id=eKNvfQzUXk data-wc=50>"You would think the kids would be very excited to be in a movie," he said during an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show. "If they were in a movie and they get to set at 8, I'd say around 9:20, I'm hearing, 'How much more?! Please let me leave!'</p><p id=ewhc7ut-de9 data-wc=30>"They make it look like I'm forcing them to do it," he continued. "Meanwhile, they were asking me the whole damn year, 'Can I be in your next movie, daddy?'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx1hZVtbm5nkZmurnnSmqWdpJWnerWxxKeYoJ1dma62s8etnKtlo6R6ta3LpWSgp6KcsrDB0madmqWZocZuvMeoq6hlnKS8rK3LoqKeZZ2kum62wJyiop1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./strawberry-cacao-nibs-waffles.html><span>←</span><span>Waffles with Strawberries &amp;amp; Cacao Nibs</span></a>
