Her Real Name, Out Of Drag, Age</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Drag Queen Spice is one-half of the first-ever identical twin featured in </span><i><span>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></i><span> history. But how do you recognize her? Simple, she’s the edgier diva of the duo!</span></p><p><span>This Drag Queen Spice Bio explores her life.</span></p><h3><b>Drag Queen Spice On RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 15</b></h3><p><i><span>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></i><span> season 15 premiered on January 6, 2023, and for the first time in its franchise history, the show featured identical twin contestants — Spice and her sister <a href=#>Sugar</a>. However, unlike other participants, these sisters were new to performing, but with sass no less than any other.</span></p><p><span>According to Spice, “a lot of creepy people” think of them as a couple because it’s “very rare that you see two identical twins walking around, and then in [their] case, it’s two identical gay twins.” But she doesn’t mind. “Growing up, you have a best friend by your side. Just having that rock on your side, going through the same thing as you [with coming out], it’s really helpful. We can talk about boys together, we can talk about all the gay struggles that you have to go through. Also, you get to trick people,” she added.</span></p><p><span>However, being paired with her sister has its drawbacks like losing individuality. She wants people to see her as her own person. It was also one of the reasons why she chose to drag.</span></p><p><span>Besides introducing the first identical twin ever, </span><i><span>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></i><span> also upped cash prize this season i.e. $200 thousand. Also, the show’s now moved to MTV,&nbsp; making it the Emmy-winning show’s third home.</span></p><p><span>Joining Spice and Sugar for the 15th installment of </span><i><span>Drag Race</span></i><span> were her co-stars Amethyst, Anetra, Aura Mayari, Irene Dubois, Jax, Loosey LaDuca, Luxx Noir London, Malaysia Babydoll Foxx, Marcia Marcia Marcia, Mistress Isabelle Brooks, Princess Poppy, Robin Fierce, Salina EsTitties, and Sasha Colby.</span></p><h3><b>Drag Queen Spice Out Of Drag</b></h3><p><span>Drag Queen Spice is a hot blue-eyed young male out of drag.
