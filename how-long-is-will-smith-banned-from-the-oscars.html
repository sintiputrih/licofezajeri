Those include actress Sacheen Littlefeather refusing to accept the award on behalf of Marlon Brando in protest of Hollywood’s treatment of Native Americans in 1973, photographer Robert Opel streaking nude across the stage in 1974, and the infamous “oops” moment in 2017 when La La Land was prematurely awarded Best Picture instead of the rightful winner, Moonlight.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Still, nothing comes close to the shocking display of violence that took place back in 2022 when famed performer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Will Smith</strong></a> got up out of his seat, walked across the Oscars stage, and slapped host Chris Rock <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">across the face on live TV</a> after the comedian made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>The moment will live in infamy, and will, unfortunately, precede both Smith and Rock for the remainder of their careers. On one hand, Smith’s actions displayed nothing but pure rage and violence in front of millions of viewers. On the other hand, the moment was shared across the globe and became a meme in only a matter of days. So it’s long-lasting impression on the realm of Hollywood is different depending on how you look at it.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>A few short weeks after the 2022 ceremony, the Academy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">issued an official ban on Smith</a>, ensuring that he become forbidden from setting foot anywhere near an Academy event or program. It isn’t permanent though, which begs the question — just how long is it?</p><h2 id=h-how-long-did-the-academy-ban-smith-from-attending-the-oscars data-injectable=false>How long did the Academy ban Smith from attending the Oscars?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Will-Smith-Chris-Rock.jpg><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>On April 8, 2022, a couple of weeks after the slap heard around the world, President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement that the Academy was implementing a 10-year ban on Smith, ensuring that even if he gets nominated for an Oscar and wins, he can’t accept it virtually or in person until 2033.</p><p>“The Board has decided, for a period of 10 years from April 8, 2022, Mr. Smith shall not be permitted to attend any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards.”</p><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public apology</a> to both the Academy and Chris Rock in the days following his outburst, Smith said, “My behavior at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable… I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong… There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness…. I would also like to apologize to the Academy, the producers of the show, all the attendees and everyone watching around the world.” Shortly after, he resigned from the Academy.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>Eventually, months later, Smith once again apologized to Rock in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public YouTube video</a>, sparking an even larger debate about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whether or not he deserves forgiveness</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=false>Nearly a year later in March 2023, Rock finally addressed the ordeal for the first time in his Netflix special Selective Outrage, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eviscerating both Will and Jada</a> in the process. While the comedy show seemed on the surface an opportunity for Rock to finally share his side of the story, some came away from it with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tastes in their mouths just as sour</a> as that fateful, infamous night back in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMpaann12ewG7DyKWjZqudnsGpecGapaedlGKzs7vMZquhnV2kwKSt0axm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-intel-optane-ssd-900p-review.html><span>←</span><span>Drive Features - The Intel Optane SSD 900P 280GB Review</span></a>
