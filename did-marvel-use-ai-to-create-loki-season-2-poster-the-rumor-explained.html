Recommended Videos Recent rumors suggest the superhero studio may have once again employed the use of AI to create the poster for the highly-anticipated second season of Loki on Disney Plus. Back in June, Secret Invasion was outed for doing something similar, although with the entire opening credits, instead of just a poster. Tensions have been on high alert since then, and it’s understandable why the mere whiff of AI in connection to Loki has roused the public."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Back in June, Secret Invasion was outed for doing something similar, although with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entire opening credits</a>, instead of just a poster. Tensions have been on high alert since then, and it’s understandable why the mere whiff of AI in connection to Loki has roused the public.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>The Secret Invasion backlash prompted the studio behind the opening credits to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">release a statement</a> ensuring no jobs were impacted. The impact on creatives’ jobs has been the crux of the AI argument, along with a host of other concerns, and was part of the reason why writers and actors took to the picket lines this summer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>However, whether Loki deserves to be lumped into the AI conversation all depends on whether or not this rumor is true.</p><h2 id=h-where-did-the-loki-ai-rumor-originate data-injectable=false>Where did the Loki AI rumor originate?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Loki-season-2-.png><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>The internet is full of rumors, and most of the time they don’t see the light of day. However, on Oct. 3, The DisInsider posted a picture of the Loki season 2 poser to X (formally known as Twitter) with claims that it had been AI-generated, and because of Marvel’s close connection to the issue, the rumor took off.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>In one of two screenshots, a close-up of the oversized clock behind Tom Hiddleston’s God of Mischief shows the smeared and slightly faded outline of the Roman numeral five. Above this, near Hiddleston’s hairline, the V in the Roman numeral seven also has a slight curve to the bottom of it. Distorted edges and squiggly lines are typically a telltale sign of AI.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Online, fans aired their complaints and expressed disappointment and frustration that Marvel (and Disney) would enact such an offense so close to its previous one.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Madly disappointed they're using AI generated imagery to promote Loki. <a href=#>https://t.co/SFhWpQfWE7</a></p>— Katria (@katriaraden) <a href=#>October 3, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Really, Disney?

So, let’s talk about whether there’s merit to this accusation.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-is-the-rumor-true data-injectable=false>Is the rumor true?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>For people saying the clock design behind Loki isnt AI:</p><p>The background they used for the poster is from Shutterstock <a href=#>https://t.co/CQdCnhiSFC</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0aLqMpEodV</a></p>— vishanti gone (@OwnerOfVishanti) <a href=#>October 3, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>The short and sweet answer is no, the rumor is not true. Marvel does not appear to have used AI to create the large clock used in the poster for Loki season 2. The image, which you can see in its entirety <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, actually belongs to Shutterstock.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>However, as pointed out by the Twitter/X user @OwnerOfVishanti, Shutterstock does allow AI art on its site, so those telltale signs pointed out above still stand. If the Shutterstock image used in the Loki poster was indeed generated by AI, then Marvel and Loki do have — in part — a connection to the AI debate, although by two degrees of separation.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>In 2022, Shutterstock launched an action plan to begin allowing AI-generated art onto its site “in an ethically responsible way.” That includes implementing on-site tools specific to Shutterstock, forbidding AI-generated art from being submitted by contributors, and compensating artists whose work is used in training models and other functionalities. You can read Shutterstock’s full FAQ sheet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=false>As it stands, there’s no reason to believe Marvel used AI to create the Loki season 2 poster from whole cloth. However, the “proof” is related only to the Shutterstock-sourced clock behind Loki, and not his variants or those of other members of the cast pictured running up the winding rail that surrounds his head. Similarly, the AI/Marvel debate could wind around in mysterious ways, down the road. If or when that happens, we will update this article.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yltcNmpJqqppq5bsHSnmSaoV2pvG6v0Z6YrZ1dobystYysnJqrn6N6c3nPqKqtnaJiwamxjKuspqeiYrK5vMuaoKedlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-kanye-go-to-sierra-canyon-school-education-and-high-school-celebrities.html><span>←</span><span>Did Kanye Go To Sierra Canyon School?
