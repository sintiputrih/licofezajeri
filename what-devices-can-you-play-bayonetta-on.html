Though the game was originally conceived as a console exclusive for the <a href=#>Xbox 360</a>, the game would also receive a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">port</a> for the PlayStation 3 at launch. The 360 version went on to become a critical success, while the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PS3 version</a> was criticized for an inferior frame rate and worse graphical performance. Despite this, the game would eventually receive several ports across multiple different platforms in the years following its initial launch.</p><p>As of now, the first Bayonetta is available on <a href=#>PlayStation 4</a>, Xbox One, <a href=#>Nintendo Switch</a>, and PC. The game was also re-released on Nintendo's Wii U in 2014 to coincide with the release of Bayonetta 2. The first game is easily the more accessible one between the first two games. Even if you're a die-hard fan of one system in particular, there's a version of Bayonetta for you to sink your teeth into. Unfortunately, those who want to play the sequel will have to rely on Nintendo.</p><p>Bayonetta 2 is <a href=#>exclusive to Nintendo consoles</a>, having been released first on the Wii U before being ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Reportedly, Nintendo were the ones who saved the sequel from being canceled mid-development. They promised to continue funding the project in exchange for console exclusivity. Despite the many platforms that you can play the first game on, Bayonetta 2 is tied solely to the Nintendo brand.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span><p>'Bayonetta 3'</p></figure><p>The same holds true for the highly anticipated sequel. Bayonetta 3 was officially announced in 2017 at a <a href=#>Game Awards</a> ceremony with a short teaser. The first official trailer and gameplay reveal wouldn't come for another four years, when the game officially resurfaced during a 2021 <a href=#>Nintendo Direct</a> conference. Like the second game, Bayonetta 3 will be exclusive to the Switch.</p><p>Though the game has no official release date, Bayonetta 3 is expected to come out some time in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydnK%2Bhk5rAbq%2FAp2Syp6Viva2t2GaZmrGfo7K1wMBmpqc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mae-rfsk-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-663872-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mae Rfsk Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
