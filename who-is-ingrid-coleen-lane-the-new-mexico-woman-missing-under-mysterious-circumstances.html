When spoken to, staff at the center said Lane arrived that day, but she left.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>According to Ingrid’s husband, Louis Scuderi, Ingrid was living with recent mental health challenges. According to Ingrid’s twin sister, Kelsey Lane, however, Ingrid seemed in good spirits, and was discussing plans for the future when last they spoke.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Once <a href=#>reported missing</a>, search parties with dogs, drones, and all-terrain vehicles combed the wooded area where Ingrid vanished. In the meantime, Ingrid’s car was found, seemingly abandoned in the wilderness.</p><h2 id=h-what-the-hunters-saw data-injectable=false>What the hunters saw</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>via KOB 4/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>As mentioned, Ingrid Lane was seen by hunters who said they helped her fix a flat tire. They said they offered to give Lane a ride back to town but she declined, telling them she was on her way to hike a nearby peak or elevation, but she didn’t specify which one. According to Lane’s husband and family, Lane was active outdoors and familiar with the area.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>Further alarm was raised when Lane’s car was discovered further along the same stretch of road, with the rear window smashed. The hunters later said the window was broken when Lane was encountered. A burner phone was also discovered inside the vehicle, according to <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. Lane’s husband, Louis Scuderi, said, referring to the phone, “That’s a huge shock to me to find out” (via Daily Mail).</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>The canine response indicated that Lane had been in the area of her car, but before long, the dogs could no longer track her scent.</p><h2 id=h-ingrid-lane-s-lung-condition data-injectable=false>Ingrid Lane’s lung condition</h2><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>As well as reported mental health challenges affecting her sleep, Ingrid Lane also lives with a lung condition, her husband said. It was not unusual for her to spend time alone, but after losing contact with Ingrid for several days, he grew concerned. Lane’s family traveled from Oregon to New Mexico to assist in the search effort. A <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> has also been established to raise funds for a helicopter.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>Lane’s husband, Louis Scuderi, told KOAT, “[Ingrid’s] my person. I don’t know how better to put it than that.”</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, Lane’s twin sister, Kelsey, added, “I have not felt her presence the same way since, and I’m trying not to read into that, but it definitely makes me sad. It makes me worry. I just hope she’s OK.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1sHnIrGSippentqV5wqijnp2eYrmiusRmq6GdXaOyuHnMnq%2Bim59ixLC5wKdkpqGjqLavs4yupZ2domK6ur%2FTnqmip6WoeqS10ZyspquklruksdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dakota-johnson-met-gala-rene-furterer.html><span>←</span><span>This Dakota Johnson- and Sydney Sweeney-Worn Blush Is Among My Favorites</span></a>
