She moved to the States as a child and lived in Boston in her later years.</p><p>In 2003, Annie was hired as a chemist at the Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Boston and worked there for the next nine years. Colleagues of Annie’s at the Hinton lab were always impressed with her work, claiming she was the fastest processor and even calling her “superwoman of the Hinton lab” on the documentary.</p><p>It was only when revelations about&nbsp;how&nbsp;Annie was so quick in the lab that it all fell into place. Annie had been faking analyses, altering drug samples, forging initials of an evidence officer in her log book, and testing samples by eye.</p><p>So not just any petty crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Annie was arrested on September 28th, 2012.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>NETFLIX NEWS</span></a>:</strong> Where is Sonja Farak from How to Fix a Drug Scandal now?</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-76983 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-2020-04-01-at-11.03.59.png alt width=1213 height=678 sizes="(max-width: 1213px) 100vw, 1213px">Screenshot: How to Fix a Drug Scandal S1 E2 – Netflix<h3>How many cases did Annie Dookhan affect?</h3><p>In April 2017, prosecutors in eight counties around the Boston area announced that they would dismiss 21,587 drug cases which had been affected by Annie Dookhan’s misconduct.</p><p>It was the largest dismissal of convictions in US history and many feared that when Sonja Farak was revealed to be tampering with evidence, they’d have another Dookhan-style overturn on their hands.</p><p>Well, they were right. When the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>misconduct was revealed</span></a> at Amherst Lab, more than 24,000 charges from more than 16,000 cases in Massachusetts were dismissed.</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SEE ALSO</a>:</strong></span> Which Love Is Blind couples are still together in 2020?</li></ul><h3>Where is Annie Dookhan now?</h3><p>Annie Dookhan was charged with obstruction of justice and evidence tampering, and sentenced three to five years behind bars in November 2013.</p><p>Given the fact Annie had no prior record, she only spent three years behind bars and&nbsp;was released on parole in April 2016. Ever since she has maintained a low profile.</p><p>Annie’s attorney, Nicolas Gordon, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>The Boston Herald</span></a> in 2016:</p><p>She’s [Annie] moving forward with her life and she has a very positive outlook on the future. I don’t think she’s made any major life decisions about what she’s going to do. She’s certainly keeping her options open.</p><p>Annie has made no comment to the press since 2013 and has not spoken on the documentary.</p><p style=text-align:center>WATCH HOW TO FIX A DRUG SCANDAL ON NETFLIX NOW</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f4f8.svg alt=? style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;<strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;<strong>GET FREAKY WITH US ON</strong>&nbsp;<span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>INSTAGRAM</span></a>&nbsp;</span><strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;<span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>FACEBOOK</span></a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K1ssuir2aqlZa5qsDYZqqhp6eofKK6zaKcZpyfpLiprc0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-jackson-kids-now-news.html><span>←</span><span>See What Michael Jackson's Three Kids Look Like All Grown Up Best Life</span></a>
