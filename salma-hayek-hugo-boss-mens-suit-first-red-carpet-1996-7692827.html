Reflecting on the outfit she wore to the 1996 premiere of her film Birdcage (her first major red carpet event) during a recent interview with W Magazine, Salma revealed that she wore a men's suit, and not by choice."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

"I'm Mexican. I'm also very short, which doesn't help with the weight and doesn't help with the design," she said, adding that she wore men's suits "for a while."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Another time, I had on a very simple black dress and I knew all the other girls were going to have fabulous dresses, beautiful jewelry,” she continued. “And can I tell you something? Instead of giving me a complex and saying that I don't have the best dress or they don't know who I am...I was like, I am fabulous. I painted some butterfly tattoos on myself and I felt happy about myself."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Salma has come a long way since sporting menswear on the red carpet. Today she's a bonafide bombshell, wearing gowns by top designers like Gucci, Versace, and Saint Laurent that are covered in sequins and lace, and accessorized with diamonds. This year at the Cannes Film Festival, the Black Mirror star wore a plunging sparkly black gown paired with Boucheron jewels, and before that, she stunned at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2023 Golden Globes</a> in a custom crystal-embroidered Gucci dress.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqjppldna66scpmn66fn2KvsL%2FSZqSepqNiwLa102adoqqjqXqzscNmmpqqoJrBbn2Ycm1mb2Zuf3l%2Blg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karamo-brown.html><span>←</span><span>Karamo Brown Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
