It’s unclear exactly how David Tennant became the poster boy for the revamped era of Doctor Who, but like so many of the adventures of the centuries-old alien, it may be a matter of timing. His original run as the tenth incarnation of the Doctor came in the reboot’s second season, meaning the show had a whole 13 episodes under its belt to experiment with tone, structure, and mid-aughts-era BBC budgets (read: £3.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jonathan Pryce on the 'fun' of playing villains and moving away from The Crown in 3 Body Problem - E</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>
