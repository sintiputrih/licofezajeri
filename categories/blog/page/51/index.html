<a href=../../../../crucial-x9-pro-and-x10-pro-highperformance-portable-ssds-announced.html></a>
Crucial's X6 and X8 Portable SSDs have been attractive budget options for the mainstream consumers looking to purchase high-capacity direct-attached storage drives. The company has been delivering some industry-firsts in these drives. However, these drives use QLC and are not particularly attractive for power users (such as content creators) who require writing vast amounts of data as quickly as possible.
Over the last few quarters, the company has been actively trying to introduce high-performance flash products in the client market.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>If youve ever wanted to see a King Arthur franchise from The Daily Wire, your prayers have</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../if-youve-ever-wanted-to-see-a-king-arthur-franchise-from-the-daily-wire-your-prayers-have-been-answered.html></a>
Despite being one of the most enduring legends in history, King Arthur hasn’t exactly had the best run of luck on the big screen throughout the 21st Century.
Recommended Videos Antoine Fuqua’s gritty and grounded origin story may have featured a stacked cast of established and rising talent, but it was roundly panned by critics and under-performed at the box office. Guy Ritchie’s Legend of the Sword was awful, and wound up as one of the biggest box office bombs in history, while Joe Cornish’s The Kid Who Would be King tanked hard as well.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Taylor Swifts Cashmere Sweater Is 50% Off Right Now</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>

IMO, no one does cozy like Taylor Swift. Between Red (Taylor’s Version) being one of the most comforting albums of all time and her obsession with stylish coats and cardigans, she knows how to stay snuggly all season long. So when Miss Swift wore a cashmere sweater back in October, I knew I had to snag it — and the style is now 50 percent off.&nbsp; The cashmere sweater in point is from Reformation and I, of course, reached for the singer-songwriter’s go-to and have been wearing it ever since.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Theater Review: The Treasurer, an Invaluable New Play</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>

From The Treasurer, at Playwrights Horizons. Max Posner’s The Treasurer, now playing at Playwrights Horizons under the assured and gentle direction of David Cromer, is a quiet revelation. At a moment when the theatrical landscape is dense with new plays that haven’t quite figured out why they’re not TV — when we struggle to dramatize the realities of our lives without trapping ourselves inside stiflingly realistic dioramas — The Treasurer arrives as an antidote.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Adam Sandler and Pedro Pascal pay tribute to Carl Weathers who dies age 76</h2><time>Jul 18, 2024</time>

Reese Witherspoon's kids look a lot like their superstar mom. And while we often talk about how much her daughter Ava resembles her, we don't talk as much about her look-alike son. Or his look-alike, Leonardo DiCaprio. That's right, Witherspoon's 13-year-old son Deacon Reese Phillippe is a dead ringer for DiCaprio. Witherspoon posted an Instagram of her two boys out getting pizza this week, and the resemblance between the two was scarily uncanny.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rumor Killer on Potential WWE SummerSlam Match, WWE Star Returning for SummerSlam?, Identity of Wres</h2><time>Jul 18, 2024</time>
