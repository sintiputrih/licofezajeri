One of my favourite examples of this is Wilderness by Sleater-Kinney, which moves instruments between the two ears to disorient the listener.</p><p>Apple’s Spatial Audio puts that on steroids, using psychoacoustics and Dolby Atmos technology to make it sound as though different music channels are coming from above you, behind you, below you and a bit off in the distance.</p><p>Songs designed for this sound incredible; Blinding Lights by The Weeknd sounds like it’s happening all around me. But songs which have it added artificially after the fact can sound a little too polished, like an image that’s been over sharpened, losing some of the soul.</p><h3>At a loss over lossless? Here are Apple Music’s new quality options</h3><ul><li>High Quality 256kbps: This is the default and will use around 3MB per minute. It will be lower if you have a slow connection or are on mobile data and haven’t allowed High Quality in Settings.</li><li>Lossless 24-bit/48 kHz: CD quality, using around 12MB per minute. Apple’s Bluetooth codec does not support this, but you can play it through a wired connection or your device’s built-in speakers.</li><li>Hi-Res Lossless 24-bit/192 kHz: Uses around 48MB per minute. You will need your own external DAC, as Apple’s Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter (and its Mac) only go to 48kHz. Hi-Res is not supported by Apple TV.</li></ul><p>High resolution lossless audio makes Apple Music look good next to streaming competitors, because it’s included at no extra cost whereas Tidal only includes it with its most premium plan. But it’s really only good news for people who use quality wired headphones or speakers, as there just isn’t enough bandwidth to convey it from your Apple device to your Bluetooth headphones.</p><p>The standard Lossless setting in Apple Music is about the same as CD quality, which is close to the <a href=#>maximum quality</a> the human ear can really appreciate. High-Res Lossless is better still, but to enjoy it you’ll need a separate audiophile-grade DAC (digital-to-analogue converter) and truly spectacular hearing. Depending on your ears you may be able to pick up some extra details and get the sense there’s more to be heard, but the jump from Lossless to High-Res Lossless won’t be as significant as the jump from cassette to CDs. Still, it’s nice to have.</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp52utXnToZxmppWserLBwKWgrbFdqLK1wMinnqxlmaN6urvUq2SaqKChsm651KygnGWdmq6vew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./troy-smith-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Troy Smith Net Worth</span></a>
