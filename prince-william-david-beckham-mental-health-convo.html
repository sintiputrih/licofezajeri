The declaration—signed by leaders of the soccer community—is a written pledge promising that British soccer leagues will make mental health a priority at all levels of the game going forward.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the video chat with Beckham and a few other players, the group discussed how the stigmas of mental health have changed in recent years. Beckham personally reflected on one of the biggest regrets in his career—receiving a red card during the England vs. Argentina 1998 World Cup—and how if social media had been around back then, the effects on his mental state would probably have been very different.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I made a mistake in '98 and the reaction at the time was pretty brutal. … If social media was around when I was going through that time, it would have been a whole different story," explained Beckham. "But I was lucky, I had a support system within Manchester United, the manager and obviously family. But did I feel it was okay at the time to go to someone and say I need help? No, because it was a different era."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Steph Houghton, a player for England and Manchester City, also partook in the chat, adding that she believes showing vulnerability makes one a better leader.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As a leader, you try and be this person that’s always strong and always really positive, but the reality is sometimes you’re going to have a bit of a bad day. I think the way that you grow as a leader and [create] the environment for people to open up is if you show that little bit of vulnerability," said Houghton. "Maybe one day you do have a bad day, you’re a bit down or you’ve maybe not played as well as you possibly can, it’s ok to show that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">William's recent video chat isn't the first time the duke has combined his love of soccer with his passion for mental health advocacy. Back in May, the prince had a similar conversation with a string of star athletes and their experiences with mental well-being for the BBC program, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jkbr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Football, Prince William and Our Mental Health" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Football, Prince William and Our Mental Health</a>.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
