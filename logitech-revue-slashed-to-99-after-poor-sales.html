<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Logitech Revue Slashed To $99 After Poor Sales [UPDATED]</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It hasn't been a great year for Logitech, and that's owing in part to the failure of their Google TV platform to take off in a market filled with cheaper alternatives. Amidst their dismal Q1 Financial Statement, Logitech announced that they would be slashing the price of the Logitech Revue below cost in order to boost sales. The box was somewhat well received by reviewers, but the original price of $299 was a sore spot, and the previously discounted $249 price garnered no favor. At $99, though, Google TV is now competing with the likes of Roku and Apple TV, still a tough fight, but not nearly so unbalanced by price.&nbsp;</p><p>This is, of course, all as the <a href=#>Google TV 2.0 update</a> is in process, and the opportunity to run Android apps on the big screen for $99 could be a truly enticing opion. It's unclear when this pricing will take affect, but it'll be interesting to see if future Google TV product pursue this aggressive pricing. We hope to get a chance to chat with Logitech reps soon so stay tuned and post any questions you might have.&nbsp;</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Logitech</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>UPDATE: Per Logitech PR, we have a few clarifications. First, as many have noticed, the Revue's $99 price is now live. Further, Logitech wanted to emphasize that the Revue was not being sold below cost, merely at a discount, this is possibly an accounting matter as there's no denying that Logitech already charged themselves $34 million this quarter as a cost of this discount. Lastly, reports that the Revue had negative sales this quarter, that is that a greater number of units were returned than sold is erroneous. The figures invovled are actually regarding channel returns, units that sat on store shelves long enough that they were sent back by the retailer. So, that's not really much consolation. It's not that it was returned too much. It never sold at all. The good news? The Google TV 2.0 update has leaked and adventurous users are welcome to see what's in store.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF2gJVoo6ifmamypLSMq5yvrZViwK2t0qGcnWWkpHp6hYyana2domK9sLvRZqqapJWo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-family-photo-baby-daughter-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Gigi Hadid &amp;amp; Zayn Malik Post First Family Photo with New Baby</span></a>
