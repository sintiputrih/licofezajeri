It’s like, thank God, because you never know [about your in-laws].”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “It’s like <a href=#>we’re all one big family</a> because the boys are best friends.”</p><p class=p1>Turner, Chopra Jonas and Danielle even <a href=#>dubbed themselves the “J Sisters”</a> — a play on husbands’ Joe, <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kevin Jonas</strong></a>‘ <a href=#>Jonas Brothers</a> band name — and frequently <a href=#>rocked out in the VIP section</a> of the group’s concerts.</p><p class=p1>Joe <a href=#>filed for divorce from Turner</a>, with whom <a href=#>he shares two daughters</a>, in September 2023.

Both Turner and Danielle were <a href=#>part of her bridal party</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It all began as a fierce song & dance competition between the families but ended, as always, as a huge celebration of love,” Chopra Jonas<a href=#> gushed via Instagram</a> several days later about their relatives coming together. “Nick and I were looking forward to the Sangeet (music evening), another pre-wedding ritual. And to see what each side had put together.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “And what a performance it was. Each family telling our stories through song and dance, filled with lots of laughter and love. We were both filled with gratitude for the effort, the love and laughter will carry the memories of this special evening for the rest of our lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Revisit-Sophie-Turner-s-Bond-With-J-Sisters-Priyanka-Chopra-Danielle-Jonas-Before-Joe-Jonas-Split-261.jpg><h3 class=p2><b>October 2019</b></h3><p class=p1>“You know, I never had a sister … [They] are all amazing achievers in their own right and we’re super supportive of everything we all do,” Chopra Jonas said on <a href=# rel=noopener>T<i>he View</i></a>. “It’s a new sort of feeling for me and it is amazing to have two girls like that to call sisters.”</p><p class=p1>Weeks later, she told India’s <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Indulge Express</i></a> newspaper that Turner loves to call herself “jethani.”</p><p class=p1>“She’s like, ‘You have to listen to me, I’m the jethani.’ She loves being jethani,” Chopra Jonas quipped to the outlet, referring to the Indian term for the eldest sister-in-law despite their age gap. (Chopra Jonas is 14 years older than the <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> alum.)</p><p class=p1>The previous March, the three women<a href=#> costarred in the band’s “Sucker” music video</a>.</p><h3 class=p2><b>March 2020</b></h3><p class=p1>Turner gushed to <i>Elle </i>that Chopra Jonas is “just the nicest person,” noting the entire family was “treated like royalty” <a href=#>during her wedding to Nick</a>.</p><p class=p1>“They live, like, 10 minutes away,” she told the magazine of Chopra Jonas and Nick, who share daughter Malti Marie. “And even though Kevin and Danielle live in New Jersey, we see them all the time.”</p><p class=p1>Kevin and Danielle, <a href=#>who got married in 2009</a>, share daughters <a href=#>Alena and Valentina</a>.</p><p class=p1>Several months earlier in January, Turner, Chopra Jonas and Danielle reunited on screen in the Jonas Brothers’<a href=#> “What a Man Gotta Do” music video.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Revisit-Sophie-Turner-s-Bond-With-J-Sisters-Priyanka-Chopra-Danielle-Jonas-Before-Joe-Jonas-Split-263.jpg><h3 class=p2><b>November 2021</b></h3><p class=p1>Turner, Chopra Jonas and Danielle did not hold back during<a href=#> the <i>Jonas Brothers Family Roast</i></a>, which dropped on Netflix in 2021. After watching the various acts side-by-side, they each got up to deliver hilarious jokes about their respective spouses.</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t even know how famous Nick was. All I knew was that he was Kevin Jonas’ baby brother,” Chopra Jonas quipped. “I’ll tell you why, because all of them combined still have less [Instagram] followers than me. So I guess the most popular Jonas is @PriyankaChopra on Instagram.”</p><h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Revisit-Sophie-Turner-s-Bond-With-J-Sisters-Priyanka-Chopra-Danielle-Jonas-Before-Joe-Jonas-Split-267.jpg></h3><h3 class=p2><b>January 2023</b></h3><p class=p1>Turner was joined by her sisters-in-law at <a href=#>the Jonas Brothers’ Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony</a>. The India native brought along <a href=#>daughter Malti</a> while Danielle accompanied her two daughters. As Turner and Joe opt not to share pics of <a href=#>Willa and Delphine</a>, their girls were absent.</p><h3 class=p2><b>March 2023</b></h3><p class=p1>When Kevin, Joe and Nick headlined <a href=#>their Broadway residency</a> at the Marquis Theater in New York City, all of their wives were spotted in the crowd. Social media users quickly pointed out that Danielle, Turner and Chopra Jonas were all dancing together throughout the set.</p><h3 class=p2><b>June 2023</b></h3><p class=p1>“I am so different than them,” Danielle revealed on the<a href=# rel=noopener>“LadyGang”</a> podcast, noting she sometimes feels “less than” compared to Turner and Chopra Jonas. “It’s actually made it work even more because we’re not trying to fight for the celebrity part of it or whatever, but it is a love-hate. I feel like I am torn. The two boys married somebody who, they’re actresses, they’re out there, everyone knows them. And I feel like I’m Danielle, and it’s hard.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “It’s also that I’m out there celebrity-wise because I’ve married [Kevin] and that’s where it’s like, ‘Oh, I wanna have something else to my name too.’ So that it feels … I don’t know, more than or like the other girls. ‘Cause then when I’m with the other girls, I feel just less than sometimes. It’s weird.”</p><h3 class=p2><b>August 2023</b></h3><p class=p1>Turner, Chopra Jonas and Danielle all attended <a href=#>the opening night</a> of the Jonas Brothers’ <i>The Tour </i>concert at NYC’s Yankee Stadium on August 12. The wives sat in the VIP section throughout the show.</p><p class=p1>While both Chopra Jonas and Danielle <a href=#>attended the second NYC show</a> on August 13, Turner was notably absent. News broke one month later that Joe filed for divorce and the docs revealed Turner and Joe <a href=#>got into a fight on August 15</a> that led to the end of their marriage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3 class=p2><b>October 2023</b></h3><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed that Turner and Chopra Jonas <a href=#>both unfollowed one another</a>. Turner still follows Danielle, Joe, Kevin, Nick, their younger brother, <a href=#><strong>Franklin Jonas</strong></a>, and their mother,<a href=#> <strong>Denise Jonas</strong></a>.</p><h3 class=p1><b>May 2024</b></h3><p class=p1>Turner addressed how <a href=#><span class=s1>she felt uncomfortable</span></a> being known as Joe’s wife in a candid <i>British Vogue </i>profile.</p><p class=p1>“There was a lot of attention on the three brothers and the wives. Well, we were always called the wives, and I hated that,” she told the magazine. “It was kind of this plus-one feeling. And that’s nothing to do with him — in no way did he make me feel that — it was just that the perception of us was as the groupies in the band.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6CdtqZ5066pp52iYryvr8Rmnq6rmJqxbq3BqKytZaCntrqtzaSYZpuYpL2zrYydmKehlaG5pnnJqKWaq12mwrDAxKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./former-rich-kid-of-instagram-star-karen-shiboleth-marries-in-dream-wedding-photos-exclusive-7556929.html><span>←</span><span>Socialite Karen Shiboleth Marries in Wedding in Italy</span></a>
