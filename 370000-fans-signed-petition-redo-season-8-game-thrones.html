The eighth and final season of HBO’s&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Game of Thrones</a>&nbsp;</strong>has been pretty disappointing. Pacing issues (things felt rather rushed and hurried), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">out-of-left-field character motivations</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questionable dialogue</a>; this latest batch of episodes hasn’t exactly sat well with longtime viewers, and the negative reactions hit an all-time high after last week’s outing.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>In response to the recent drop in quality, dedicated fans took it upon themselves to make things right. Earlier this week, someone created a petition on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org</a>, in an effort to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HBO remake the show’s final season with a new set of writers</a>. We reported on the campaign yesterday afternoon, and at the time, only 30,000 fans or so had pledged their support by signing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Game-of-Thrones-Season-Finale-Dany.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Game-of-Thrones-Season-Finale-Tyrion.jpeg><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=918 data-injectable=true>That’s all changed, though. It seems the petition has since gone viral, and the number of supporters has skyrocketed in the last day. At the time of writing, over 370,000 believers have jumped on board, and the campaign – created by one Dylan D. – is now one of the most popular on the site. While this might seem too good to be true, it’s worth noting that Game of Thrones&nbsp;is a global phenomenon, with fans based all over the world. As a result, the petition has been signed by viewers from all around the globe.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=false>A few of us here at We Got This Covered originally thought that the petition would go largely ignored by HBO, but considering its recent rise in popularity, we’re curious to see if the network will respond to the fans. Either way, even if the campaign fizzles out, we’re hoping that the <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> finale manages to turn things around. If you haven’t yet been completely turned off by recent episodes, make sure to catch it when it airs on Sunday, May 19th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3x0g49pZ2lllpa7tHnSop6nnZRivabAyK2gqKZdp7Klu4ysnJqrn6N6eXnGmqSeZaSdv7C6xKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ann-sothern.html><span>←</span><span>Ann Sothern</span></a>
