This artwork was shown to George Lucas in a presentation. Doug [Chiang] came back and said, ‘Congratulations, James. You got a George “Fabulouso” stamp.’</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Adds Lucasfilm executive creative director, Doug Chiang:</p><p>After working with George on the prequels for seven years, I knew in some ways how to anticipate what forms he would like – which is really good, because he still likes those forms. So for the Jedi temple, he loved that bell shape. It’s reminiscent of some of the imagery that [original Star Wars trilogy concept artist] Ralph McQuarrie painted way back.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>We’ve also learned that George Lucas&nbsp;initially toyed around with the idea of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exploring Leia’s Force abilities</a> throughout this current Star Wars trilogy – she is a Skywalker, after all, but one who actually chose to reject the Force some years prior – which would have resulted in a totally different arc for Carrie Fisher’s on-screen Resistance leader.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>Elsewhere, <strong>The Last Jedi</strong> continues to exert its dominance at the global box office – China notwithstanding – and is expected to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clear $500 million</a> by end of day Tuesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqq2ZomLEor7SZp6ep6Kcsm641JyYrGWkp7atu8ayZKOdlJ56tbHMqaOeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-long.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Long Wiki, Height, Age, Wife, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
