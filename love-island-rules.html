There are lots of little things that the singles must remember while hanging around the villa. These rules need to be followed to a tee or they could end up in quite a lot of drama.</p><p>Of course, there are the basics like how the show works and functions. However, did you know that there's also a whole slew of other rules on the set? Let's walk you through everything you need to know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What are the rules of 'Love Island'?</h2><p>The show kicks off with the contestants choosing to couple up based on first impressions. Throughout the show, there are different opportunities to uncouple and couple up with someone new.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ITV</span></figure><p>The challenge is making sure someone wants to couple with them. If not, they'll be booted off the show. Plus, the audience sometimes has the chance to weigh in and vote people out of the villa.</p><p>To make sure the show has some shakeups, new islanders are sometimes added into the mix. Introducing new personalities offers new dynamics and can split up even the strongest of couples.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Island USA (@loveislandusa)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are there other rules on 'Love Island'?</h2><p>Yes, outside of just the gameplay, there are guidelines that the islanders must follow. One of the biggest is that there is a zero-tolerance policy for violence on the show, which means that even if you're fighting, you have to keep your hands to yourself.</p><p>After all, there is historical proof that acting out can get you removed from the show. For example, Sherif Lanre was famously sent home for kicking Molly-Mae Hague in the crotch. The catch is that it was a total accident while they were just play fighting.</p><p>Even then, the rules are clear, so Sherif was sent home. It didn't help that after the accident he made an insensitive joke about the ordeal. It wasn't the best look for Sherif.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Island USA (@loveislandusa)</a></p></figure><p>Sherif later released an apology via ITV, writing, “In a case of poor judgment, I broke the villa rules and as a result agreed with the producers that it was best for me to leave the villa."</p><p>In addition to rules against violence, the contestants are also expected to detach from the outside world. This means that they aren't allowed to use their phones during the duration of their stay. If you see someone posting to their accounts, it's probably a friend or family member on their behalf.</p><p>However, players in the United Kingdom aren't even allowed that! Now, their pages must remain inactive as a preventative measure against cyberbullying and harassment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Island USA (@loveislandusa)</a></p></figure><p>When it comes to substances, there are also rules, too. There are no drugs allowed while filming the show which makes sense due to legal issues surrounding them. However, they can smoke cigarettes in certain places. When it comes to alcohol, they must be mindful of their consumption and are cut off when they reach a limit.</p><p>Bullying and harassment are also banned from the show, especially the use of slurs. Sexual harassment is specifically a concern too. Cast members do receive some training on sensitive topics ahead of time to help mitigate potential issues.</p><p>There is also no nudity and no masturbation in the showers. While the show can get steamy and raunchy at times, there are still certain limits to it all. Wearing clothes doesn't come without its own set of rules either. Wardrobes are pre-approved and can't have any branding on them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYyiqqWZnpl6s8HLnqo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lilibeth-morillo.html><span>←</span><span>Lilibeth Morillo</span></a>
