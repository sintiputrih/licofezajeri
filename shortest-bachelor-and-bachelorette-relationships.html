Word of advice, if you want to be with a woman, you need to become a real man!”</p><p>Following <a href=#>Peter and Hannah Ann’s split</a>, then-host <a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> went to Alabama to tell Madison it was over. While Peter and Madison made plans to take their relationship one day at a time during the After the Final Rose taping,<a href=#> they were over t</a>wo days later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Madi and I have mutually decided to not pursue our relationship any further,” the pilot wrote on Instagram at the time. “Believe me this was not easy for either of us to be OK with, but after a lot of honest conversations, we have agreed that this is what makes most sense for the two of us. The love and respect I have for Madi will continue to endure.”</p><p>She added at the time: “As Peter and I have decided to go our separate ways, I am confident that we will both move in the direction of our purpose and never forget that God has a plan in all things,” she wrote. “I will always love and respect him. I am convinced our paths were meant to cross and we are both better because they did. @pilot_pete you are an amazing guy and I’m thankful for you. I will always be your biggest fan. And to the amazing women I met this season, I will love you for life.”</p><p>Peter and Madi may win for the shortest relationship, but they certainly aren’t alone.
