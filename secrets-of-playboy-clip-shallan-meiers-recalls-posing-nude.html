She was one of seven semifinalists but lost to<strong> Lauren Anderson</strong>, who was Playmate of the Month in July of that year.</p><p>Anderson is also set to appear in season 2 of Secrets of Playboy, which will explore the aftermath of several women’s associations with the brand. Season 1, which featured <a href=#>interviews with Madison</a>, 43, and <a href=#><strong>Bridget Marquardt</strong></a>, aired last year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Madison later said that it was <a href=#>difficult for her to watch</a> the docuseries after sharing her experience with its creators. “I watched all of them except episode two. I don’t want to watch myself talk about my trauma again,” she recalled during an August 2022 episode of <a href=#>her “Girls Next Level” podcast</a>. “I can’t take it. But every other episode, I watched — and it came out over the course of 12 weeks. I had nightmares after I watched them. I had a nightmare I was back at the mansion every single night after Secrets of Playboy.”</p><p>Secrets of Playboy season 2 premieres on A+E Monday, July 10, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqem6KawbR5zp9kqaSRrq%2BwxYyco6KoXai1orjLmqVmpZWesrO%2FjKucnJmcocBuvM6soKefXaPCpbGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-treks-michael-dorn-hopeful-worf-spinoff.html><span>←</span><span>Star Treks Michael Dorn Is Hopeful For A Worf Spinoff</span></a>
