Per <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Bieber agreed to a paternity test, though the outcome is unknown. When he and Gomez broke up, things got even shadier.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2016, Bieber appeared to move on to new lady love Sofia Richie and proceeded to post snaps of the rumored couple on social media. When his fans blasted Richie in the comments, <a href=#>an account claiming to be Gomez</a> wrote a comment suggesting the "Yummy" singer shouldn't post pictures of his girlfriend if he can't handle the response. In retaliation, Bieber wrote back (via <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>), "It's funny to see people that used me for attention and still try to point the finger this way. Sad."</p><p dir=ltr>In a 2020 interview with <a href=#>NPR</a>, Gomez also alleged that her ex-boyfriend emotionally abused her during the relationship.&nbsp;"I do feel I was a victim to certain abuse," she said. "... I had to find a way to understand it as an adult." Though Bieber didn't respond to her claims, in a 2019 <a href=#>Instagram</a> post the singer opened up about abusing his romantic relationships from the age of 19 after he started using heavy drugs. He wrote, "I became resentful, disrespectful to women, and angry." He noted that he's since turned his life around.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
