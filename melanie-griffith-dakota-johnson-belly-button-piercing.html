The real cool mom is Melanie Griffith, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer">Dakota Johnson</a> confirmed during an appearance on The Late Last Show with James Corden. Not only did she mention that Griffith took her to get her belly button pierces — at age 14 — she was also on hand when Johnson got her very first tattoo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She took me to get my belly button pierced when I was 14, and she also got her belly button pierced. I don't know why I am telling you this," Johnson told Corden, before adding, "My mom took me to get my first tattoo." Another fun fact came out as well. Johnson also said that when she got her belly button pierced, Griffith got one, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Johnson explained that she has a collection of "11 or 12" tattoos, a number she calls "conservative in 2021."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"'I'm not a tattoo fiend. It's 2021. That is conservative," Johnson said. She noted that as she's gotten older, she does have some regrets. "I regret some of them because they are just silly now." The one she called out was "action not words" in Latin, which sits on her forearm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Corden jumped in with a tattoo story of his own, saying that he thought that he had gotten the Chinese character for "tattoo" on his lower leg — only he didn't. Instead, the character that he ended up getting actually translates to "happy go lucky."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It means happy go lucky, which I'm not mad at," he said. "But then someone else told me they thought it might mean 'crane.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Machine or a bird?" Johnson asked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The machine, I think," Corden said. "I'm fine with 'happy go lucky.' I'm pleased with 'tattoo.' And if it means 'crane,' I'll live with it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8OaoqiskWK3sLTNrKanZ52auaK6yJ5koKqZm7OqwMdmm5qjn6mubrbOoaWsp55ir6a4y7Jkm62kqbyvec%2BinKubmaO0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaxon-willard.html><span>←</span><span>Jaxon Willard</span></a>
