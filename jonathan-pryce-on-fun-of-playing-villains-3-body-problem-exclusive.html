Although he didn't have a real-life counterpart in mind while filming , he compares Evans to tech mogul Elon Musk. "Except I think his belief system is stronger than Elon Musk's," he jokes.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaXJEFoRoFL data-wc=19>So, what is it that attracts Jonathan to playing villains? Is it the sheer fun of playing a baddie?</p><p id=eMNM-imSbyG data-wc=53>"<strong>It's fun to play</strong>," he agrees. "I've been doing it for 52 years and there are things that are innate and things you absorb. I find it very easy to absorb characteristics," says Jonathan, who signed onto the role while filming season five of The Crown, in which he stars as Prince Philip.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3e7ade8ddb49-jonathan-pryce-3-body-problem.jpg><p id=ed6OK472xWj data-wc=65>"With Prince Philip, all I had to do was watch newsreels of him, I'd never heard him speak," revealed the actor. "So that research was interesting but I knew what kind of man he was. But Mike Evans is someone with enormous confidence and when you're that rich and that powerful, you don't have to do that much. It's how other characters react to you."</p><p id=eATjnhAwcQO data-wc=19>It was also the opportunity to reunite with showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who co-created</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43185ac2d860-jonathan-pryce-got.jpg><p id=epnxDK8LX5V data-wc=34>"Working with them again, whatever it was going to be, was going to be a really good experience," says Jonathan. "They're great producers. They're on set nearly all the time. They have great energy."</p><p id=esgO8e_CM5s data-wc=53>Most of Jonathan's scenes took place onboard the oil tanker Judgment Day in a set built at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Viewers of the drama will know that Evans spends a lot of time in a locked-off room talking to the San-Ti via a microphone – scenes Jonathan says were "fun to do".&nbsp;</p><p id=e6_LGu3b5N2 data-wc=26>"People ask me, 'What's it like acting with this speaker?' My response has been, '<strong>It's not the first time acting with something so wooden</strong>'," he jokes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c4f8de764aa-queen-prince-philip-the-crown.png><p id=eRdmg6dMuKy data-wc=43>"Once you're in that very bare, austere room, I was very comfortable thinking it was my space and I'd chosen to share it with whoever I thought I was talking to.
