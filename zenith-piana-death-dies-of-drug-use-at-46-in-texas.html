Police reportedly discovered 20 bottles of steroids at his residence, as reported by TMZ. However, due to a combination of potential contributing factors and the inability to conduct a toxicology report, the official cause of death remains ‚Äúunknown,‚Äù according to an autopsy report obtained by Men‚Äôs Health.</p><p>The autopsy findings noted ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù heart disease, Rich Piana‚Äôs history of drug use, and a limited number of hospital specimens as reasons for the inability to determine a specific cause of death. Any one of these factors could have potentially played a role in his passing.</p><p>The Florida District Six Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office confirmed that a toxicology report was not conducted to establish whether drugs in Rich Piana‚Äôs system contributed to his death. While the autopsy report did not definitively link his death to drug use, it also couldn‚Äôt rule out the possibility. Dr. Pellan, a forensic pathologist, explained, ‚ÄúDue to the lack of available admission specimens, drug involvement could not be ruled out. There is no evidence to suggest that drugs played a role in his demise.‚Äù The findings did, however, indicate an enlarged heart in addition to coronary atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), suggesting that heart disease might have been a contributing factor, although the role of drug use remains uncertain.</p><p>Rich Piana‚Äôs passing has left the bodybuilding world in shock, and as the community grieves, questions surrounding the cause of his death continue to linger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kx6a6yK2fZqiZlruiecOemK2gXZm2pr%2BMqJ1mnKKqtG7B0p5kmqxdaYNutc1mq56wkah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-be-on-hbo-max.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Will Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom be on HBO Max?</span></a>
