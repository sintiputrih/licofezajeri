No one is lost unless they like living under a rock.</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>So here it is, the day that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has been promised to the world, and what happens? New promotion art is published on Instagram for an entirely different movie that won’t be released until November. After diving deep and investigating this oversight, it has been determined that Marvel Studios had nothing to do with the leak and probably has nothing to do with the art either. It appears to be the art of a zealous fan who is excited about The Marvels and could care less about the final installment of Guardians.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Iron Man Taiwan (@ironman.tw)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=823 data-injectable=true>While Chris Pratt still mourns from the loss of Gamora, he has to lead the crew to save the world once again and if they are successful, they just might save themselves. With a cast that includes Karen Gillan as Nebula, Vin Diesel as Groot, Dave Bautista as Drax, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, and somehow, Zoe Saldana as Gamora again, they stand a chance just as they always have. Not to mention, Will Poulter is playing Adam Warlock. Watch the movie to find out how Gamora finds herself in Vol. 3.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>With fans watching the final Guardians already, The Marvels is still in post-production. It’s not even in the can yet. Even though the cut film has yet to be swept off the editing room floor, “Iron Man Taiwan” feels it’s important to remind everyone about the movie that is coming starring Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel, and Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>While the internet is mainly confused about it, it’s just fan art and nothing more than that. For now, take one step at a time and enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 out now in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXaKus8LEpapmrKKesrR506hkoaGalrCsecaumKucmZa7tHnOn2StoJVitKK4wLGwZq6foXp0v4yboKBllJbGbq7YZpueqJykxqq6xmaZq5memXqvsdZmp6unnaR6or7TaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sierra-dallas.html><span>←</span><span>Sierra Dallas - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
