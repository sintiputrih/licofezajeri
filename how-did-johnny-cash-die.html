But, his personal life was equally filled with lows. For many years, he struggled with mental health issues and addiction. Consequently, answering the question, “<strong>How did Johnny Cash die?</strong>” requires a closer look at the man, his life, and his career leading up to his death. Let’s get started.</span></p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-Did-Johnny-Cash-Die.png alt="How Did Johnny Cash Die" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Early Life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash was born on February 26th, 1932. He was raised in Arkansas in a rural community. When he was just five years old, his family moved to a colony provided by the government. This allowed them to work on the land that they would later be given the option of owning.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash was just five years old when he was put to work with the rest of his family, picking cotton in the fields. As they worked together, they would frequently sing. This is where Johnny Cash first got his taste and love of music.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At twelve years old, he had to deal with the death of his elder brother, Jack, who died in a horrific farming accident. At around this time, Johnny began learning the guitar from his mother and a friend. He would also begin to write songs about his life and experiences.</span></p><p><strong>As a child, he was most heavily influenced by Gospel Music…&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although, he also showed a keen interest in Irish Music whenever it was played on the radio. Within six years of starting to play the guitar, he had become reasonably proficient. He was also becoming an accomplished singer and getting used to signing in a deep baritone voice following his voice change from a tenor a few years previous.</span></p><p><strong>This all brings us neatly to his enlisting in the Air Force in 1950…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash stayed in the Air Force for four years and specialized in radio communications. Later, he was assigned to the 12th Radio Squadron as a Morse code operator, taking him to Landsberg, Germany. Interestingly, this involved intercepting messages from the USSR which led to him being the first person in America to know of Stalin’s death.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 1954, he was discharged from the Air Force as a staff sergeant and returned to Texas. Shortly after, in the same year, he married his first wife, Vivian Liberto. He had met her before being posted to Germany and had obsessively corresponded with right up until his discharge.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>I am only going to touch briefly on the illustrious&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>career of Johnny Cash</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. That’s because Johnny Cash released over two hundred singles and two hundred albums. Consequently, I will just stick with the highlights. As well as provide context for how it relates to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash’s life and eventual death</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 1954, he auditioned for Sun Records but was turned away. Johnny Cash played Gospel music during his audition but was curtly told that they did not record that kind of music anymore. Allegedly, he was also told to go away, do some sinning, and return with some new songs later.</span></p><p><strong>As most people know, Johnny would indeed go on to do some sinning…&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But he listened carefully to what he was told and returned with some new songs. One of which was&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“<strong>Cry Cy Cry</strong>“</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Sun Records were impressed enough that they signed him up. As a result, it became&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash’s debut release</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in 1955 and went to #14 on the US Country Charts. This was the start of his dazzling career and would result in over 90 million album sales worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The following year,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash’s first #1 US Country song</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;arrived with the wonderful&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“<strong>I Walk</strong> <strong>the Line</strong>“</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. It also gave him his first charting single on the main US charts, peaking at #17, and earned him his first gold disc on his home turf. “I Walk the Line” was quickly followed in the same year with “</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>There You Go</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>”. That track also went to #1 on the Country charts.</span></p><p><strong>For the next 35 years…&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was seldomly out of the charts. Some of&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash’s biggest hits</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;would include the Country chart-topping songs&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“<strong>Don’t Take Your Guns to Town</strong>“</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in 1958 and&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“<strong>Ring of Fire</strong>“</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in 1963. As well as his biggest hit song,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“<strong>A Boy Named Sue</strong>“</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in 1969, which also earned him his best Billboard Album Charts position at number two. His last #1 US Country hit was “</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>One Piece at a Time</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>” in 1976.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Turmoil></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Turmoil</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Turmoil.png alt=Turmoil width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As his career took off, Cash slowly became addicted to painkillers and amphetamines. He also became heavily reliant on alcohol which caused him to get in a series of scrapes. Consequently, his life became less and less stable within a very short space of time.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite his incredible career success, his marriage quickly went sour. In 1966,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash’s first wife</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Vivian Liberto, called things to an end. They already had four daughters, but his constant drug use, drinking, and widespread adultery became too much. Additionally, his constant touring also put an even bigger strain on an already fragile marriage.</span></p><p><strong>Around this period…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cash had a series of run-ins with the law and spent a few nights in prison. He was arrested for drunk driving, trying to bribe a police officer, possession of pharmaceutical drugs, and various drunk and disorderly offenses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 1965, during a drunken and drug-infused session, he even managed to burn down 508 acres of forest land. That little stunt ended up costing him $82,001 after a court settlement. That isn’t a lot of money today but was a heck of a lot of money back in 1965.</span></p><p><strong>Despite all his misdemeanors…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And, contrary to public perception, he never spent longer than a single night in jail at any one time. However, his frequent brushes with the law through the late-50s inspired him to come up with a novel idea. Performing live concerts in jail. The most famous of these was at San Quentin State Prison in 1958.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>That performance was so successful that it was made into an album in 1969,&nbsp;</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Johnny Cash at San Quentin</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Ironically, it would prove to be&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash’s best-selling album</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and kick-started his flagging career that had fallen into a bit of a slump due to his addictions.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The prison concerts did a lot for Johnny Cash, and he made sure that he gave back in return. He became an advocate for improved prison conditions and fought for other many other social injustices, such as those suffered by the Native Americans.</span></p><p><strong>His period of turmoil had a brief respite from 1970 to 1977…&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>That was because two years earlier, he married his second wife, the famous June Carter, with whom he had a #2 US Country hit with “</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Jackson</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>” in 1967. Three years later, they later had a son together, John Carter Cash. The birth of his son inspired him to get clean. But, sadly, by the end of the 70s, Johnny was back to using drugs again.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His life from that point was a vicious cycle of drug-using and failed rehabilitation attempts. It was also punctuated by his wife’s frequent requests for him to quit, interspersed with her flushing away his various stacks of drugs. A terrible way to live.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Johnny_Cash_Die_%E2%80%93_Health_Issues></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Did Johnny Cash Die? – Health Issues</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>By the 1990s, Johnny Cash was beginning to suffer from several health issues. He suffered from a series of heart problems that would ultimately require a double-bypass surgery. Additionally, he had diabetes, neuropathy, and Shy Drager Syndrome, which is closely associated with Parkinson’s. As if all this wasn’t bad enough, he also experienced frequent bouts of pneumonia.</span></p><p><strong>So, what was going on?</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For starters, he was getting old. However, that was only a small part of the story. His widespread use of amphetamines and painkillers was catching up with him. Plus, his drinking was further exacerbating his already poor health condition.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The sad fact is that all of Johnny Cash’s illnesses have an increased chance of occurring if you are drinking and abusing drugs. Additionally, if you do have these conditions, they will only get worse if you continue to abuse your body. Consequently, it is fair to say that Johnny Cash ended up a victim of his behavior and actions over the course of most of his adult life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Things looked increasingly bleak for Johnny Cash. Then, they got a whole lot worse. That is because, out of the blue, his beloved wife was admitted to hospital in 2003 with a heart condition that required immediate treatment. Sadly, she never recovered and died in hospital. This was effectively also the end for Johnny Cash.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Final_Months_and_Death></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Final Months and Death</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Final-Months-and-Death.png alt="The Final Months and Death" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>June was always expected to outlive Johnny. So, her death was unexpected even though she was a couple of years older. When she died, it was as if a light was switched off for Johnny. His rock and the glue that held his life together were no more.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before she died, he had promised her that in the unlikely event that she died first, he would continue to record, and he was true to his word. Most poignantly, as one of&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash’s final recordings</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, he covered the Nine Inch Nails song “</span><strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Hurt</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.” This proved to be one of his greatest pieces of music and probably his best-ever video for which he won a Grammy. It was clearly his goodbye to the world.</span></p><p><strong>He did not have long to wait long…</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash passed away on September 12th, 2003. So,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>what was the cause of Johnny Cash’s death</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>? Officially, it was complications caused by diabetes. However, we must go back to his early life and his rise to fame to fully answer this question.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>That is because his inability to cope with stardom, plus his subsequent misuse and abuse of alcohol and drugs, were the real root cause of his death.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Curious_About_How_Other_Famous_Musicians_Died></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Curious About How Other Famous Musicians Died?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If so, check out our thoughts on&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Did Elvis Presley Die</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Did Marvin Gaye Die</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Did Michael Jackson Die</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Did Whitney Houston Die</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, and&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Did Amy Winehouse Die</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;for more information about&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>famous musician deaths</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Johnny_Cash_Die_%E2%80%93_Final_Thoughts></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Did Johnny Cash Die? – Final Thoughts</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnny Cash had a fascinating life filled with success, awards, and accolades. However, behind the fame and glitz was a man that struggled to keep his life together. He was a man who fought regularly to vanquish his personal demons. But, sadly, he was all too often on the losing side.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The answer to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>how Johnny Cash died</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;is tied to the way he tried to cope with success and how he conducted his private life. Plus, more importantly, how he looked after, or rather, how he neglected his health. He left us far too early, but I am glad he got to walk amongst us, and I thank him for the music.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Until next time, let the music play.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jqGmsGWUnrFuts6hpaexXZiutLSMnaCeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./debbie-harry-net-worth-how-much-is-debbie-harry-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Debbie Harry Net Worth: How Much Is Debbie Harry Worth?</span></a>
