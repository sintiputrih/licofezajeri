He also described a “v” shaped pen that was designed to specifically be used to facilitate the sexual activity, according to the police report.</p><p>Authorities received a search warrant and reportedly obtained&nbsp;a large amount of homemade videos along with recording equipment and cameras.</p><p>The boy described his horrid living conditions in the trailer park that he shared with his father, where he had no access to electricity and collected rainwater so that he could take showers.</p><p>Clearfield County District Attorney William A. Shaw Jr. said there are currently no allegations of the boy being sexually molested and that authorities have no reason to believe that he was.&nbsp;“Right now, we don’t believe the juvenile was sexually victimized,” Shaw said.</p><p>The boy has been taken into protective custody, and investigators have yet to determine&nbsp;the extent of mental or physical abuse that he may have been exposed to.</p><p>The men are being held in prison on $100,000 bail as they await their trial and subsequent sentencing.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, engaging&nbsp;in any form of <a href=# rel=noopener>sexual intercourse with an animal</a> is penalized as a misdemeanor of the second degree. They face a maximum of two years in prison and a $5,000 fine for bestiality, although they may face a harsher sentencing taking into account the alleged crimes committed against the boy and the prolonged period of time that the criminal activity took place.</p><p>Law that dictates the legality of bestiality happens at the state level, and believe it or not, there are still a number of states where it’s legal to have sex with an animal. Washington D.C., Hawaii, Kentucky, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming all deem bestiality legal, and most of those states also allow for the sale and distribution of zoophilic pornography.</p><p>Next, read this story about a man that said a <a href=#>horse consented to sex by winking at him</a>.
