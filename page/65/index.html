Classic, am I right? In all fairness, the film has some rather wholesome moments, as well as some surprise big-name cameos, so let‚Äôs take a look at the cast and where they are now.
Recommended Videos The 2011 comedy starring Sandler and Aniston in lead roles saw the former playing the character of a plastic surgeon, Daniel, who, after lying to a young woman he fell for (yes it was her ‚Äúamazing personality‚Äù for sure, not the fact she looks like a supermodel), asks his assistant Katherine, Aniston, to help him cover up the lie by pretending to be his soon-to-be-ex-wife.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Queen Latifahs husband?
