He makes every ball that goes through his feet better. I’m just calmer when he has the ball, it’s that simple,” summed up his manager Xavi after the game.</p><p>Pedri hadn’t played since February after he picked up a hamstring injury in the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Europa League</a> tie against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Manchester United</a>. He has been so sorely missed that Xavi, and the player himself, tried to rush his return for the La Liga Clasico against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Real Madrid</a> last month, resulting in a setback in his recovery.</p><p>Those who are close to the player were, back then, fuming with Barca’s backroom staff for allowing such a risk to be taken. To be fair, concerns over his physical condition go back a little further.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/04/24023843/GettyImages-1252114781-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Pedri and Barcelona team-mates celebrate Sunday’s 1-0 La Liga win (Photo: Lluis Gene/AFP via Getty Images)</span><p>Pedri hit the ground running during his first season at the club and did not really stop. By the end of the 2020-2021 campaign, he had appeared in 52 games, missing not one match through injury.</p><p>During the off-season, he took part in the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>European Championship</a>, where he was named the tournament’s best young player, before flying off to Tokyo to feature in the Olympic Games.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Spain</a> reached the semi-finals at the Euros and the final at the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Olympics</a>, with Pedri playing more than 90 minutes on five occasions as matches went to extra time. It’s fair to say it did not look like the most sensible way to take care of an 18-year-old’s body. A year later, he got confirmation that it wasn’t.</p><p>After a debut season free of injuries, Pedri has missed 44 Barcelona games due to physical issues over the two campaigns since. And now, when he is injured, they really miss him.</p><p>“Without Pedri, our whole idea falls apart,” a source from Barca’s backroom staff told The Athletic some weeks ago.</p><p>The stats reflect it quite well. Pedri has played in 22 league matches this season, with Barcelona winning 19, drawing two and losing one. Of the eight league matches he has not been on the pitch, Barca have won five, drawn two and lost one. That’s a win-rate percentage of 86% with him in the side, dropping to 63% in his absence.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Without Pedri on the pitch, Xavi’s side have made an average of seven fewer passes into the final third per game. They’ve registered one fewer shot per match and, most importantly, have conceded on average three more shots on goal.</p><p>It’s quite significant as well to see how, without Pedri, Barcelona cross into the box a lot more often. Their average of 12.3 open-play crosses per game with him jumps to an average of 18.3 when he’s not on the pitch. Basically, that’s a case of Barca losing a part of their essence; their positional play and movement through the inside pockets.</p><p>Barca with and without Pedri in La Liga</p><table class="in-article table sortable border-transparent-imp in-article-striped in-article-no-column-border-right in-article-no-column-border-left"><tr><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><p>With Pedri</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left></span></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><p>Without Pedri</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></th></tr><tbody readability=2><tr><td><p><span>22</span></p></td><td><p><span>Games</span></p></td><td><p><span>8</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>19</span></p></td><td><p><span>Wins</span></p></td><td><p><span>5</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>2</span></p></td><td><p><span>Draws</span></p></td><td><p><span>2</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>1</span></p></td><td><p><span>Losses</span></p></td><td><p><span>1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>44</span></p></td><td><p><span>Goals for</span></p></td><td><p><span>10</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>2</span></p></td><td><p><span>Average goals for</span></p></td><td><p><span>1.3</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>7</span></p></td><td><p><span>Goals against</span></p></td><td><p><span>2</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>0.3</span></p></td><td><p><span>Average goals against</span></p></td><td><p><span>0.3</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>86.4</span></p></td><td><p><span>Win percentage</span></p></td><td><p><span>62.5</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>2.7</span></p></td><td><p><span>Points per game</span></p></td><td><p><span>2.1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>15</span></p></td><td><p><span>Shots per game</span></p></td><td><p><span>14.3</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>8</span></p></td><td><p><span>Shots conceded per game</span></p></td><td><p><span>10.5</span></p></td></tr><tr readability=3><td><p><span>12.3</span></p></td><td readability=5><p><span>Open-play crosses per game</span></p></td><td><p><span>18.3</span></p></td></tr><tr readability=3><td><p><span>65.6</span></p></td><td readability=5><p><span>Passes into final third per game</span></p></td><td><p><span>58.8</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It is an issue that is well-recognised within the club. In fact, it’s something they realised last season and it’s why Xavi was pushing to try to sign <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Manchester City</a>’s <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bernardo Silva</a> in the summer, with the Portugal midfielder meant to provide Pedri with support.</p><p>Now, despite their financial struggles and the fact targets such as Bernardo are practically off the table with Barcelona only being able to afford free transfers, there’s a new plan to give Pedri a break, one that revolves around another Manchester City player: <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ilkay Gundogan</a>.</p><p>Nearing the end of his contract, the 32-year-old has received a special request from Xavi to fill the role he had planned for Bernardo a year ago.</p><p>Messi is also extremely wanted by the backroom staff, for the same reason. There’s a lack of quality in the final third and an extreme overreliance on Pedri — arrivals such as these would be able to solve this issue.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Lionel Messi back to Barcelona: Political, complicated but very real</p></a><p>While we wait to see how all that unfolds, at least on Sunday Barcelona finally managed to find the net having gone three matches without scoring in all competitions.</p><p>It was <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ferran Torres</a> who got the goal, finishing a counter-attack on the brink of half-time. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Raphinha</a> deserves credit for his tremendous work rate and assist, as does <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a>.
