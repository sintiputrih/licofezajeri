Oh, it’s <strong><a href=#>Harrison Ford</a></strong>! The iconic actor was recently spotted during an outing in Los Angeles on Monday, September 16.

It seems like Harrison may have also enjoyed a nice workout as he was spotted looking slim and sweaty while sporting casual athletic leisurewear.</p><p>Fans couldn’t be happier about Harrison looking and feeling healthier than ever considering he is set to star in the upcoming <a href=#>Indiana Jones 5</a> movie. Last November, a source close to the Star Wars: A New Hope actor revealed to <a href=#>OK! magazine</a> that he’s been dedicating his time to working out so he can be in the best shape for filming, which is set to begin at some point in 2020.</p><p>The insider dished that Harrison is preparing for the film by “lifting heavy weights at his home and at the health club he goes to in L.A.”</p><p>However, the source added that actor has had to tone down his workout routine considering he suffered a couple injuries over the few years. In 2014, Harrison broke his leg after it was crushed by a hydraulic door while filming <a href=#>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a>. Then, in 2015, he suffered lacerations to his face and broke his pelvis after his <a href=#>vintage plane crashed into a golf course</a>.</p><p>“Harrison knows he really has his work cut out for him,” the source explained. “But he’s not giving up and won’t stop pushing himself.”</p><p>Although production has been delayed and the original release date of July 10, 2020, was pushed back to July 9, 2021, The Fugitive actor gushed that he can’t wait to be apart of Indiana Jones 5. “I’m looking forward to working with [director] <a href=#><strong>Steven [Spielberg</strong></a>] again and to revisiting the character later in life,” he explained during an appearance on the&nbsp;<a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;>Graham Norton Show</a> in September 2017. “It will be fun and a good thing to do.”</p><p>We can’t wait to see Harrison star in Indiana Jones 5! <strong>Until then, scroll through the gallery below to see how youthful he looks during his recent outing!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hmKuqmai8r3nFqKmdZaOdvLi%2FjKidn2WemsRutMCiqZytpGKxtr7Ip55mm5%2Bbs6axjKisraGenHqxtM6tpqxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halston-blake-fisher.html><span>←</span><span>Halston Blake Fisher - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Wiki, Facts</span></a>
