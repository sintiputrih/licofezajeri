We’ve got no idea, but the conservative outlet is going to try for some reason. As revealed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, the outfit has acquired the rights to literary fantasy series The Pendragon Cycle, a six-book saga retelling the well-trodden tale centuries before its established medieval setting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/king-arthur.jpg><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>Why are The Daily Wire moving into ambitious fantasy territory? Who knows, but it’s happening. co-CEO Jeremy Boreing described it as the budding studio’s “most ambitious” project to date in the “no sh*t” statement of the day, before outlining his plans for the property.</p><p>“It’s based on perhaps the most impactful myth in Western tradition, the Legend of King Arthur. Today, I’m beyond thrilled to announce that&nbsp;DailyWire+ has secured the rights to produce an adaptation of the novels as a series to stream exclusively on our platform.”</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=false>We’ve seen three Arthurian epics in the last 18 years, and they all fared poorly with either critics or at the box office, and regularly both. Is The Daily Wire capable of arresting the slide? We’ll be goddamned if we’ve got a clue, but it’s certainly bizarre enough to merit keeping an eye on as it progresses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooJ9lqaTCt7GMnq2eql2srq%2FAxJ1kraddqLKmecBmoqKml2Kus8DHrqlmnqKWu6S0yKycZp6ipLpuwMeeZJ2ZmaHGbsPIq5xmsZ%2Bqv2680ZqwnqqjYrWiwsRmmZ6dnmKur7%2FWnqmenF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./crucial-x9-pro-and-x10-pro-highperformance-portable-ssds-announced.html><span>←</span><span>Crucial X9 Pro and X10 Pro High-Performance Portable SSDs Announced</span></a>
