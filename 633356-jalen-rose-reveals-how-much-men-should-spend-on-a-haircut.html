His hairline has been praised for years, and it feels as though he is getting a new haircut every single day. Overall, Rose has been very forthcoming about his hair regimens. He is someone who always has his barber on call, and he is always ready to shell out a few bucks to keep his hair looking crisp. Although, it makes sense that he would do this when you consider he is on television for ESPN pretty well every single day.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For many, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">going to the barber can be an anxiety-inducing</a> experience. For instance, there is an expectation that you will have to engage in small talk. If you are socially anxious, this is a no-fly zone. Moreover, there is the risk that the barber goes his own way and gives you something you didn't ask for. Finally, there is always the chance you just get a wack haircut that you want to cover up with a baseball cap.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jalen-rose-tells-all>Jalen Rose Tells All</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rose is someone who knows these feelings all too well, and recently, he came through with some advice for people looking to have a good experience at the barbershop. However, if you are someone on a budget, then this advice probably won't work out too well for you. "The minimum you're supposed to be spending for a quality barber is $100...So many guys & people out there think y'all gon' show up & get a fly haircut for $35," Rose said. It's interesting advice, however, not everyone is going to have that much to spend on their hair every month.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Either way, it is very easy to see how Rose has such immaculate hair. When you have the barber connects, things become easier. For the average person, the message is simple: get your money up. Until then, you will have to hope and pray that the barber you go to won't mess you up. Or, you can just go bald and avoid the barber for the rest of your life. Let us know what you think of Rose's advice, in the comments below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
