To create the look at home, she says to begin by curling your hair with a 1.25” curling iron. Once curled, tease your hair at the crown with a comb. (She suggests the Tangle Teezer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Ultimate Teaser</a>, $14).

Paris Hilton’s high, straight pony looks downright lacquered. To get the look, amika pro stylist & Stylist Collective member <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Eric Vaughn </a>says to start by flat ironing your hair (he suggests the amika <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Confidante Styler</a>, $150) to create a smooth base before adding any clip-in extensions for extra volume in your tail. Once your hair is straight, he says to use mousse from your roots to your crown to slick your hair back into a flawless snatched pony. To lock it in place, use a strong-hold hairspray, such as the amika <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Headstrong Hairspray</a> ($26). Don’t stop there, though. You’ll want to add shine, too.

To achieve the clean, classic look—illustrated on Taylor Hill, above—Marino says to pick where you want your part. Then, use a smoothing cream or a few spritzes of leave-in conditioner to smooth your hair from the roots down to the nape of your neck. Secure it with an elastic and it’s as simple as that. “If any front pieces don’t reach all the way into the hair tie, spray them with a strong hold hairspray to hold them into place,” Marino says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-middle-part-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Middle-Part Pony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Karwai Tang&nbsp;/ Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This look has really taken off in the last few years,” she says. To achieve the look at home, she says to section out your bangs or face-framing strands. After clipping them out of the way, she says to brush the rest of your hair into a high ponytail and secure it with an elastic. “Once secured, let down the bang section and create a middle part,” she instructs. Smooth each section back toward your ponytail, but go one side at a time to maintain the part. Secure the pieces with an elastic over the top of the first one and finish with hairspray.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-flirty-flip></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Flirty Flip</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>James Devaney&nbsp;/ Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This is a good example of how small detail can make a big impact,” Brager says of Margot Robbie’s prim and proper pony from an outing in NYC. “Margot's high ponytail and side parting is a perfect pairing for a polished look.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>To achieve her full pony, Brager suggests adding extensions.

To get the look, she says to spritz your hair with a lightweight leave-in conditioner, combing it through from roots to ends. “Section out some face-framing pieces, then pull the rest of your hair into a high ponytail,” Marino instructs. If you decide you want to fully recreate Slate’s bun, Marino says to simply twirl your ends and pop a few bobby pins into place.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-relaxed-side-bang-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Relaxed Side-Bang Pony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Steve Granitz / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even with bangs, a ponytail can easily dress up any occasion,” says amika Pro Stylist and Stylist Collective member <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Yene Damtew</a>, who turns our attention to Taylor Swift to illustrate her point. “The soft pony can be achieved on days-old curls which is amazing.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-high-perky-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The High, Perky Pony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Neilson Barnard&nbsp; / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The way Sims sees it, volume never goes out of style so a high, perky ponytail with a va-va-voom tail (like Laverne Cox’s above) is always a good idea. To create such a style, gather all of your hair into a high ponytail and use a boar bristle brush to smooth from your hairline to your crown. Secure your ponytail and use a curling iron or wand to add curls throughout. (If you prefer to curl your hair before putting it up, you can do so as your first step.) Take a small section of hair (a half-inch thick, or so) and wrap it around the base of the pony, pinning it in place on the underside so that it’s concealed. If you have fine hair, Sims reminds us that creating a smooth bun foundation works well as a base for adding extensions into place.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-natural-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Natural Pony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Frazer Harrison&nbsp;/ Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for a pony to show off your natural texture?

With that in mind, Sims says that high, straight, glossy ponytails (like Tessa Thompson's, above) are, too. “The classic high ponytail is effortless and can easily make any look more glamorous,” he declares. “To create this look, smooth the front of the hair before gathering it to the crown of the head. Tie a hair band around the hair. Then, for a bone-straight ponytail, apply a straightening serum to the hair before using a flat iron to smooth out any frizz.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-mid-level-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Mid-Level Pony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Paul Archuleta / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a more relaxed but still glamorous ponytail hairstyle, Sims suggests keeping it mid-level and letting a few face-framing tendrils spring out, like Gabrielle Union did, here. To get the look, he says start with a center part, leaving a few longer pieces out around your face. “Try to grab pieces that, as they fall, will gently graze your cheek,” he instructs. “Then, pull the rest of your hair (minus the long pieces in the front) toward the back/middle of your head. Make sure to smooth the sides to ensure your ponytail is tight.” After securing your ponytail, Sims says to use a curling iron to add waves throughout.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bubble-ponytail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bubble Ponytail</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Frazer Harrison / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Issa Rae’s bubble ponytail is one for the books. To achieve the look, Bravo TV Celebrity Hairstylist Julius Michael, who is a VOLOOM Brand Ambassador, says to pull your hair into a low ponytail.&nbsp;“Take small elastic bands or bow ties and create little puffs of bubbles starting about one inch from [the base of your] ponytail,” he instructs. To really puff up the bubbles, gently tug on the sides before moving to the next section. “After your bubbles are created, you'll want to make sure they are all neat and even,” Michael adds. If you have fine or short hair—or simply want more volume or length—he says to consider clip-in extensions when exploring the style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-low-long-wavy-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Low, Long Wavy Pony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Taylor Hill&nbsp;/ Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ciara looked like an absolute goddess when she showed up to the Met Gala with a bum-length center-parted low pony.

Zendaya’s retro curled-up pony with side bangs. To get the look, he says to apply a smoothing balm or cream to damp hair. Using a round brush, smooth all of your hair while blow drying. (He says using a straightening blow-dry brush makes the process even easier.) Once your hair is dry, Vaughn says to section out your bangs and pull the rest of your hair into a sleek, high pony, maintaining a side part if you can. Secure the ponytail and wrap a few strands around the elastic to conceal it. Then, style your leftover face-framing hair into a dramatic side-swept bang, locking it in place with hairspray and bobby pins just below the base of your ponytail.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-ariana-pony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Ariana Pony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Steve Granitz&nbsp;/ Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How could we write a story about ponytail hairstyles without honoring the woman with perhaps the most iconic pony ever?

To create such a perfectly high pony, you have to be mindful of placement, she says. “Focus on getting the base of the ponytail in the perfect profile position—the top of the crown,” she instructs. “Positioning the ponytail at the top of the crown or top of the head ensures you’ll be able to see the ponytail from the front.
