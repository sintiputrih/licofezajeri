Its conclusion has some wondering how many more seasons of the show are planned for the future, and asserting that the show could easily end here, before it drags its story out for too long.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>A huge number of cameos, some stellar story developments, and plenty of tie-ins to the upcoming Ahsoka helped season three of the series stand out. Even Dave Filoni himself — the man behind many of the most popular modern Star Wars offerings, including a heavy hand in The Mandalorian — made a quick appearance in the show’s latest episode, leaving fans delighted.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Despite Mando overwhelming the vast majority of alternate <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi</a></strong> properties, the official drop of Netflix’s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once & Always managed to seize a bit of attention. The special’s arrival on Netflix is stirring up some serious nostalgia in longtime fans, and it could take awhile for them to move past the flick’s gut-wrenching ending.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-once-always-successfully-wrecks-longtime-fans data-injectable=false>Once & Always successfully wrecks longtime fans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/charlie-kersh-minh-kwan-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-once-and-always-1.png><p data-characters=695 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>The Power Rangers franchise is quite clearly aimed at kids, and Once & Always is certainly no exception, but the Netflix special digs a bit deeper than many fans were expecting. The cheesy one-liners and charmingly hoakey fight scenes are all there as well, but the special’s conclusion left many viewers in tears. That’s due to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a touching dedication</a> included in the 55-minute Once & Always’ final moments, paying tribute to several beloved staples of the franchise, who unfortunately passed away before the special dropped. The dedication, paired with a heartwarming song, was too much for some viewers to handle, particularly at the conclusion of a goofy, child-oriented program.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Will The Mandalorian return for more seasons, or was season 3 the last?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Mandalorian-Moff-Gideon.jpg><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>The official conclusion of The Mandalorian’s third season left many viewers satisfied, and some theorizing that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series could end here</a>. Not everyone wants to see the show conclude just yet, however, and these viewers are in for good news. The show’s fourth season is already in development, and there may well be plans for Mando to return for more seasons past the next. We don’t know for sure <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if season four will be the last</a>, but rest easy, Mandalorian fans, there’s still more story to tell.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Dave Filoni appears for a hilariously obvious Mandalorian cameo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Dave-Filoni.tiff><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=false>The most recent season of The Mandalorian has been chock full of surprise cameos, but even Lizzo and Jack Black can’t quite equal out to the season finale’s big celebrity guest. Dave Filoni, the man behind The Clone Wars, Rebels, and The Bad Batch, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared in the season’s final episode</a> — and he didn’t even bother to take off his quintessential cowboy hat.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbr%2FComSfoV2jsri%2FjJ2Yr51dm7atu82iZKaZm5rAbrTIrGScp6eXvLp5x5qrZqiRp8Fuu8Vmqq2ZomLEor7SZpqapp%2BjeqK%2FjKagoKCkrnquu9Gpn6KmXaW8uLHRZqmappeav7R5zqeanmWRocSixdJmo56ZpprAbrLAp6pmoZ5iwaat0axm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drag-queen-spice-bio-real-name-out-of-drag-partner.html><span>←</span><span>Get To Know Drag Queen Spice!
