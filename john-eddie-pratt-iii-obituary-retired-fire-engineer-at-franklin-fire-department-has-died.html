Engineer Pratt dedicated 34 years of his life in the service of the Franklin community, leaving an indelible mark on the department. His commitment and unwavering dedication to public safety will be remembered by those who had the privilege of working alongside him.</p><p>Engineer Pratt’s illustrious career, which spanned over three decades, culminated in his retirement from the Franklin Fire Department in 2014. His legacy is one of selflessness, courage, and a tireless commitment to protecting the lives and property of the community he served. To pay respects and honor his memory, visitation will be held at Williamson Memorial in Franklin on Wednesday, November 15, from 4 PM to 8 PM, and on Thursday, November 16, from 10 AM to 1 PM. The funeral service is scheduled for Thursday, November 16, at 1 PM, immediately following the visitation.</p><p>The interment will take place immediately after the service, featuring full firefighter honors as a tribute to his service and sacrifice. As the Franklin Fire Department mourns the loss of one of its own, the community is invited to join in commemorating Engineer Pratt’s life and expressing condolences to his family during this difficult time.
