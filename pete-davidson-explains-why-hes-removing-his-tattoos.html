So you can’t see anything and the doctor’s in there with you.”</p><p>The doctor then has to ask the patient for verbal consent to remove the tattoo, the comedian explained. “So before he goes to laser each tattoo, you have to hear him announce what the tattoo is to make sure if you want to keep it or not,” he recalled. “So I’ll just be sitting there all high off of the [nitrous oxide] … and then all of a sudden I’ll just hear, ‘Are we keeping the Stewie Griffin smoking a blunt?’ And then I have to sit there and be like, ‘No, Dr. G.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pete-Davidson-Explains-Why-Hes-Burning-Off-Some-His-Tattoos-005.jpg><p>At one point, Davidson had <a href=#>more than 100 tattoos</a>, including a <a href=#><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> </a>portrait, the ghost emoji, a quote from Harry Potter character Albus Dumbledore, a drawing of New York City’s Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Winnie the Pooh and multiple <a href=#>tributes to his father</a>, Scott Davidson, a firefighter who died responding to the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“If you’re going to get tattoos, just make sure you really, really want it — and aren’t on mushrooms,” advised the Set It Up star, <a href=#>who is currently dating</a> <a href=#>Bridgerton</a> actress <a href=#><strong>Phoebe Dynevor</strong></a>.</p><p>Host <a href=#><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></a> pointed out that Davidson’s story was a “really important lesson” for <a href=#>those thinking about body art</a>. “It’s not just that one day you’ll have them taken off, you will have to have them audibly described to you by a medical professional,” the New Year’s Eve star, 47, quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYrK5vMuaoKerXay1unnHnqpmqpWivLe1zaBkoaGjYsGiwNOopqxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./laveranues-coles-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Laveranues Coles Net Worth</span></a>
