Wow, What an adventure we’ve been on since the day he was conceived! I thank God everyday for blessing me with his super active energy (wonder where he gets it from? 👀) and now to meet our healthy baby boy?! Thankful. Blessed,” <a href=#>she captioned an Instagram photo</a> with their newborn on Saturday, April 24. “Now it’s party of 5 baby! Thank you my @mattpokora for being the best partner/dad/ best friend a woman could ask for. You’re a king in my eyes.”</p><p>The singer, 39,<a href=#> revealed her baby bump</a> in December 2020. “You and me + 3. #MoreLove,” the New Jersey native captioned a silhouette shot via Instagram at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Christina-Milian-Gives-Birth-3rd-Child-Her-2nd-With-Matt-Pokora.jpg><p>Fellow pregnant stars commented on the social media upload, from <a href=#><strong>Cassie</strong></a> to <strong>Khadijah Haqq</strong>. “Omg!!!! I’m screaming!!!! Congratulations you guys!! This is amazing!!” the Step Up star, 34, wrote, while the Dash Dolls alum, 37, added, “Omg yassss!”</p><p><a href=#>Milian became a mom in March 2010</a> when she and her then-husband,<a href=#> <strong>The-Dream</strong></a>, welcomed their daughter, Violet.</p><p>When it comes to coparenting with the Grammy winner, 43, the Grandfathered alum exclusively told Us Weekly in May 2020 that the former couple were “manag[ing].” Milian explained, “We’ve done so well. It’s been 10 years.<a href=#> I’m really proud of how we’ve always put Violet first</a> and our friendship goes along with that as well, but we get along great.”</p><p>The “Dip It Low” singer added at the time: “Violet has siblings in Atlanta, and we just check on each other and make sure everybody is doing whatever we can. When it’s time, we get the kids together. … We shift off summers and holidays and things like that.”</p><p>Violet became a big sister in January 2020 when <a href=#>Isaiah was born</a>. She felt <a href=#>“so excited”</a> about her new role before her baby brother even arrived.</p><p>“She’s always rubbing my belly now,” Milian gushed exclusively to Us in August 2019. “She thinks it’s gonna be a boy. So she already has her dibs in for that, so we’ll see.”</p><p>The Love Don’t Cost a Thing star and Pokora, 35, started dating in August 2017, and parenting has made them “stronger” and “closer” as a couple, Milian said of the French singer in May 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She told Us, “We’re already best friends, but I mean to have this together and to look at each other and just know what we’ve done together, it’s just grown into that kind of real unconditional love. I see that he loves being in his role as a father.”</p><p>Pokora was “so in love” with Isaiah and “ready to make more,” Milian added at the time. “I’m like, ‘Hold on, my body’s not ready!’ I just want to enjoy this moment. I’m like, ‘Well, maybe, do we hurry up and keep going so that we can knock it out?’ [A quarantine baby] is not out of the picture.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZpkpqGcnq6vecairZ6rXZe2s8DHZquoZWOnsW6vx6KjnWWYmr9ufs2dZLChpJ16rq3TrWSpp5ukv6J7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cardi-bs-second-fashion-nova-collection-is-out-targeting-your-girlfriends-side-bitces-baby-mamas-mamas-aunties-sisters-and-more-280447.html><span>←</span><span>Cardi Bs Second Fashion Nova Collection Is Out, Targeting Your Girlfriends, Side Bitc*es, Baby</span></a>
