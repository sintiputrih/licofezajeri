The player can also skip the battle against <a href=# title="Blue (game)">Blue</a> in Cerulean City.</p><p>In normal gameplay, the player would battle Blue at the north exit of Cerulean City, then go through the Route 25, and ultimately <a href=# title=Bill>Bill</a> would give the <a href=# title="S.S.

(The guard stops blocking the door as soon as the player receives the S.S. Ticket.) The player would normally be unable obtain any Pokémon with Cut before going to S.S. Anne and receiving the <a href=# title=HM01>HM01</a> (<a href=# title="Cut (move)">Cut</a>).</p><p>It is still possible to return to Cerulean City and battle Blue at any point in the future, even after the player has already defeated him at the <a href=# title="Indigo Plateau">Indigo Plateau</a> and became the <a href=# title="Pokémon Champion">Pokémon Champion</a>. However, Blue still uses the same team that would be expected in Cerulean City.</p><p>If the player skips the Sea Cottage, they will be unable to board the <a href=# title="S.S. Anne">S.S. Anne</a> (which would require the S.S. Ticket) until they obtain the ticket. However, as this requires trading in a Pokémon knowing Cut, they will not need the HM01 from S.S.

Once the drink item is deposited, it can be withdrawn to another Generation I game later.</p><p>This method is normally unavailable in the earlier games <a href=# title="Pokémon Stadium (Japanese)">Japanese Pokémon Stadium</a> and <a href=# title="Pokémon Stadium">Pokémon Stadium</a>, because each player has their own item storage, with no option to transfer items between players. However, in these Stadium games, the players are identified by their name and ID. As a result, items can be freely transferred between Generation I core series games that have the same player name and ID.</p><p>This method is unavailable when playing the Generation I games at the <a href=# title="Virtual Console">Virtual Console</a>, because it has no connection with the <a href=# title="Pokémon Stadium series">Pokémon Stadium series</a>.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Ghost_Marowak_bypassing>Ghost Marowak bypassing</span></h4><p>In Generation I games, there is an <a href=# title="List of glitches in Generation I">oversight</a> causing the <a href=# title="Poké Doll">Poké Doll</a> to end the battle against the <a href=# title="Marowak (ghost)">ghost Marowak</a>.</p><p>In normal gameplay, the player would explore the <a href=# title="Team Rocket Hideout">Team Rocket Hideout</a> and obtain the <a href=# title="Silph Scope">Silph Scope</a> to reveal the ghost Marowak that blocks the way to the <a href=# title="Pokémon Tower">Pokémon Tower</a> 7F. However, the player can completely skip the Team Rocket Hideout and simply bypass the ghost Marowak by using the Poké Doll. (However, as a side effect, the player would be unable to battle or catch any <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild</a> <a href=# title="Gastly (Pokémon)">Gastly</a> or <a href=# title="Haunter (Pokémon)">Haunter</a>, because the Silph Scope would be normally used to reveal them as well.)</p><p>As usual, once the ghost Marowak is gone, the player can talk with <a href=# title="Mr. Fuji">Mr. Fuji</a> at the Pokémon Tower 7F and return with him to his house, in order to obtain the <a href=# title="Poké Flute">Poké Flute</a>. From this point onwards, the player can also enter <a href=# title="Silph Co.">Silph Co.</a> (the Rocket Grunt stops blocking the way at the entrance)</p><p>After using this glitch, it is possible to battle Giovanni out of order: first in <a href=# title="Silph Co.">Silph Co.</a>, then in <a href=# title="Viridian Gym">Viridian Gym</a>, then in <a href=# title="Team Rocket Hideout">Team Rocket Hideout</a> (which was supposed to be the first battle against him). This contradicts Giovanni's dialogue in Silph Co. ("So we meet again!", "I lost again!?") because in this case he never battled the player before. It also contradicts Giovanni's dialogue at the Viridian Gym, where he says that Team Rocket is finished forever, but in fact Team Rocket still remains in the Team Rocket Hideout.</p><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Yellow Version">Pokémon Yellow</a>, it is also possible to battle the <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket trio</a> out of order: in <a href=# title="Mt.

This requires obtaining a <a href=# title="Bike Voucher">Bike Voucher</a> in <a href=# title="Vermilion City">Vermilion City</a> and then backtracking to <a href=# title="Miracle Cycle">Miracle Cycle</a> in <a href=# title="Cerulean City">Cerulean City</a>.</p><p>If the player attempts to enter the Cycling Road (through the entrances on either the <a href=# title="Kanto Route 16">Route 16</a> or the <a href=# title="Kanto Route 18">Route 18</a>) without a Bicycle, the guard blocks the player from entering. This also causes the player to automatically walk one tile to the right, facing away from the Cycling Road. However, due to an oversight, it is actually possible to enter the Cycling Road without a Bicycle, simply by insisting and pressing left while the guard is in the process of blocking the player.</p><p>Once this is done, the player will automatically ride a Bicycle as long as they are on the Cycling Road, even if they have never obtained this item in the first place.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Red.2C_Blue.2C_Yellow.2C_FireRed.2C_and_LeafGreen></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Red,_Blue,_Yellow,_FireRed,_and_LeafGreen>Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=S.S._Anne_bypassing>S.S.

However, the player also has the option to skip the S.S.

Anne, then this ship will depart indefinitely once the player leaves it. However, if the S.S.

The player can also reach the ground tiles surrounding the water and see a truck parked there. The truck serves no purpose in <a href=# title="Generation I">Generation I</a>, but has a hidden <a href=# title="Lava Cookie">Lava Cookie</a> in <a href=# title="Generation III">Generation III</a>.</p><p>In Generation I, it is still possible to return to S.S.

However, Blue still uses the same team that would be expected in S.S. Anne. However, in <a href=# title="Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a>, if the player enters <a href=# title="Lavender Town">Lavender Town</a> without having battled the rival in S.S.

The player will also receive the <a href=# title=Tri-Pass>Tri-Pass</a> and be able to freely use the <a href=# title=Seagallop>Seagallop</a> to travel between the first three islands. However, once this mission is over and the player returns to mainland <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a>, they will not be able to travel to the Sevii Islands again until the HM01 is obtained and the S.S.

Unlike in Generations I and III, the harbor is not considered a part of the S.S.
