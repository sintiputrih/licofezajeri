Not only is this just another premiere, it is one incredible track that you’ll no-doubt enjoy – we’ve definitely listened to it half-a-dozen times already. We are talking about OBB’s new title track, “Is This A Thing”, taken from their EP of the same name, which will be released on July 6.</p><p>OBB is one of the current soaring acts around at the moment. They are a trio consisting of the Oswald brothers: Zach, Jacob, and Nich. They’ve been building their career for a number of years going from strength to strength since they released their debut EP is 2011. Recently, their song “Sweater” has become their biggest hit, with nearly over 2 million Spotify streams; while their follow-up single “Mona Lisa”, is quickly gaining attention and has featured in Google’s Chromebook ad campaign, as well as Dude Perfect’s YouTube Video “Water Bottle Flip 2”, which has over 60 million views. Now, they are gearing up to release their new EP, titled “Is This A Thing”, on Friday – we cannot wait.</p><p>This exclusive track we have for you is joined on the EP by the previous two single “Sweater” and “Mona Lisa”, making this a brilliant three-track collection of songs. Of the song, Zach Oswald said: “We wrote this song during that awkward stage in a relationship where both people are too afraid to just come out and say what they’re feeling. We’re left wondering what the other person is thinking – is this a thing or are we just friends?”</p><h3>Listen To The CelebMix Exclusive Premiere Of OBB’s Title EP Track “Is This A Thing” Here:</h3><p>The first thing that hits us with this song is OBB’s stunning vocals; all three voices are rich and full of emotion, clearly honing in on the very thing that made them write this song. It’s a track many people are going to identify with especially since the lyrics explain a situation that we’ve all been in from time to time. It’s not just that, the backing track is one undeniable beat that truly gets stuck inside one’s head – if you can’t remember the words, you’ll be forever stuck with humming the beat of the track for the rest of the day.</p><p>“Is This A Thing” will be released on OBB’s new EP of the same name, on Friday, July 6, via Curb Records, Inc. We’d like to thank them for allowing us to exclusively premiere this song, and we suggest you watch out for our upcoming EP review, their social media takeovers which will be happening on Friday, as well as our upcoming exclusive interview with the trio.</p><h4>What do you make of OBB’s track “Is This A Thing”?
