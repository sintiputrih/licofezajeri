The duo has yet to officially comment on the situation publicly, however. In fact, the exact nature of their relationship is currently unknown, although they seem to be happily married.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>LaBeouf and Goth tied the knot in 2016 before they announced they were amicably parting ways in 2018. A reconciliation appeared to have taken place, though, by the time the Peanut Butter Falcon actor was spotted wearing a wedding ring in April 2020, with Goth likewise caught on camera wearing both a diamond ring and a wedding band. More recently, the couple were seen arm-in-arm on a day out at Disneyland in June 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1c0b1a24-b331-4aca-883d-f81463e88eb7-getty-1185815950.jpg><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>The English-born Goth was most recently featured in 2020 Jane Austen adaptation Emma and 2021 action drama Mayday.

His reputation has taken a hit over the past 12 months or so, however, following former partner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FKA Twigs suing him</a> for emotional, physical, and sexual abuse.
