I've never been pregnant." She added, "On the other hand, it feels very natural: I am very mothering. Whether I end up having children or not, I will always be a very mothering person."</p><p>Ross revealed, "The key is you ask yourself, What do I need right now? I've cultivated a relationship with myself where I know I have choices... I have a toolbox of ways I can find support; journaling is helpful, or meditation." She even coined her own terminology to describe her life:&nbsp;"choice-ful solitude." She told&nbsp;Glamour, "I have had to really make friends with loneliness. And know the difference between choice-ful solitude and lonely. [I find comfort in] being able to name it, to say I'm feeling lonely, then to have a tribe of people I feel safe enough with to share: This is how I feel."</p><p>Ross's 2017&nbsp;speech at&nbsp;Glamour's Women of the Year summit was so profound that she was still talking about it during a May 2020&nbsp;<a href=#>Porter</a> interview. She admitted that she was nervous that the speech would be seen as "frivolous." But looking back on her "my life is mine" statement, Ross said, "I realized there was a lot of identification with that sentiment. We are told that our lives are not ours. We are taught and cultured in that way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tnbn5ze9ahsGasopawprGMnqOloaNiv7C%2F0magrKakYrqivtGinJ1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shirley-ballas.html><span>←</span><span>Shirley Ballas- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity</span></a>
