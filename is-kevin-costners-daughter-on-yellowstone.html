Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) is John’s only daughter and by far the most vicious. Supporting herself as a banker in adulthood, she immediately moves back home to Montana as soon as her father needs her. Outside forces like a cancer scare and a real estate development threaten to crush the stronghold that they have held for a century and a half.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Beth is not above blackmail and manipulation, even going as far as to antagonize her brothers for not stooping to her level. John’s daughter is undoubtedly the stand-out character in Yellowstone, but what about Costner’s real-life daughter, and will she give Beth a run for her money?</p><h2 id=h-is-lily-costner-on-yellowstone data-injectable=false>Is Lily Costner on Yellowstone?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>With their father an icon in the entertainment industry, Costner’s daughters are no strangers to the limelight. Since they were young, he included them in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some of his best films</a>. Annie Costner has fallen into producing as of late but appeared in various roles in Dances With Wolves, The Postman, and Waterworld. Her sister, Lily, also had a role in The Postman as Lily March but has since diverted her attention to another form of entertainment.</p><p data-characters=598 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Though she has not had an acting role in her father’s modern Western, she has made her presence known in the series in a different way. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wide Open Country</a>, Lily collaborated with her father for the song “Heaven’s Gate.” The song appeared on the album Tales From Yellowstone, which he created with his band Kevin Costner & Modern West. An apt name for the band considering Costner’s interest in Western fare, the album features music from the television show he stars in. When speaking to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Huffington Post</a>, he had nothing but glowing reviews for his daughter’s talent.</p><p>“Lily is an amazing singer and songwriter. She can be a really huge star if that’s what she wanted. I’m not sure she wants that. She’s really gifted. Lily’s way is not to knock doors down. I think she wants a quality of life. She’s seen the quality of life that we’ve had and sometimes the idea of stardom, I think, is a mystery to her. She’s content with performing.”</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>His daughters certainly seem satisfied with blazing their own trail. Especially if that means they don’t have to tangle with the formidable Beth Dutton.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yknK%2BhnmKwsL%2FTp5yrq12Zrrazx62cq2Wfo3q6sculprCrpKS7pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-chris-hemsworth-have-cameo-netflix-interceptor.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Hemsworth Wound Up With An Interceptor Cameo At Netflix's Request</span></a>
