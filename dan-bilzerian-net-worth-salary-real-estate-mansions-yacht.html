Moreover, he is not the only one into poker; his brother Adam Bilzerian is also one of the renowned poker players.</p><h3>In the Army</h3><p>Dan Bilzerian joined the Navy, followed by basic SEAL training, which is now prominent for the execution of Osama Bin Laden. But, he did not graduate as a working military member.</p><p>He must have gotten the military interests from his father, Paul, who received a bronze star for his service in Vietnam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Dan-Bilzerian-Using-Tanks.jpg><p>Dan had intentions of becoming a part of the SEAL special forces unit when he first chose to join the military.</p><p>The training was for 24 weeks and aimed to strengthen the physical and mental stamina of the trainees.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dan suffered from a broken leg which extended his training for a period of a year and a half.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of his injured leg, he failed to make it through SEAL training and was discharged honorably, providing him with a disability allowance as a veteran worth $6,000 per month.</p><h2>Education & Poker Career</h2><p>After his return from training, Dan Bilzerian studied at the University of Florida for four years, majoring in Business and Criminology. Similarly, he would make time to learn poker simultaneously.</p><p>While continuing his study, Dan sometimes ran short of money at some point, so he had to sell guns.</p><p>Which was not enough, followed by finding poker as an alternative. He got so good at it that the Bliz made $90k per week.</p><p>Eventually, he dropped out of college to continue his career as a professional poker player. Dan Bilzerian’s net worth is what it is today due to his involvement in high stake games.</p><p>Not only known as a player but also an investor, Dan made a hefty sum from ‘Victory Poker.’</p><p>In the 2008 World Series of Poker Main Event, Bilzerian was placed 180th.</p><p>Buff magazine voted Dan one of the funniest poker players on Twitter in 2010.</p><p>In 2011, he was one of the poker players sued by the estate of Bradley Ruderman over winnings from poker games, which were paid with funds from an illegal Ponzi scheme.</p><p>The former baseball shortstop&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a> was defended by Bilzerian publicaly against accusations that he had gambled illegally. Bilzerian stepped in by claiming that A-Rod was absent when the alleged gambling event occurred.</p><p>On November 2013, the Instagram sensation played ‘Heads Up No-Limit Hold’Em’ while staking $5k to $10k per game.</p><p>The King of Instagram claimed an unconfirmed victory of $10.8 million on a single night of playing poker.</p><p>Dan claimed, having won $50 million throughout the year, he “doesn’t play against professionals anymore, and the most he’s ever lost in a single session is $3.6 million.”</p><h2>A Bona Fide Pro</h2><p>Yes, the money-spending and lavish lifestyle are ever-present in Bilzerian’s life, but what is more evident is his flair for business.</p><p>He isn’t willing to lose money and not expect to get it back.&nbsp;Dan even bet his lawyer $400k when he participated in a drag race, one of the dubious claims of staking.</p><p>Although Bilzerian’s love for money is immense, he is willing to turn down offers that don’t seem lucrative enough for him.</p><p>For instance, an unnamed Facebook co-owner offered $100k if Dan shaved his beard, but he isn’t into it, declining the offer upfront.</p><p>Similarly, Dan’s life is a pure gamble of madness. He holds high-stakes poker games with BILLIONAIRES.</p><p>Poker may be his main gig, but his side hustle includes working as an actor, business ventures, influencer, and stuntman in films like Olympus Has Fallen, The Other Woman, Equalizer, and Lone Survivor.</p><p>A well-recognized internet celebrity, Dan has mouth-watering earnings from his social media.

Not just that, but they get to sleep under a $700 blanket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Dan-Bilzerian-With-Models.jpg><p>Furthermore, the King of Instagram owns several houses in Los Angeles, La Jolla, and San Diego occupying a vast land with exquisite views.</p><p>Also a travel freak, Dan often rents out his condominiums and houses while exploring the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan has loaded weaponry lying at his house.

He lives an utterly lavish life, which often brings him into a risky position.</p><p>The King of Instagram was very near to death after he consumed drugs rampantly at a party.</p><p>He discussed taking six times the recommended dose of V****a, excessive c**a**e, and weed and drinking for four days straight with a sleep of about an hour.</p><p>Any person would suffer hazardous consequences with a lifestyle as brutal as his. He underwent two heart attacks.</p><p>The doctor claimed that there was no issue with his heart and that the drugs were to be blamed for his deteriorating health. According to a source, he was 25 when he went through this on 1 October 2017.</p><p>Dan claimed that the doctor was Conard Murray, infamous for being charged with involuntary manslaughter over the death of Michael Jackson as he had administered the singer with a lethal dose of propofol.</p><p>Fortunately, from that day, Dan has focused on leading a good life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Diet</h2><p>Dan Bilzerian has a stunning body weighing almost 187 pounds.

Similarly, his evening meal is filled with protein and dry fruits.</p><p>He eats chicken or turkey, rice, and veggies for his dinner. Moreover, he consumes supplements and multivitamins to attain his fitness goal.</p><h2>Controversies</h2><p>Money and fame will surely attract challenges, and when you are as rich as Dan, you are sure to attract some to your name.</p><p>In 2014, Bilzerian sued the Lone Survivor film producer and demanded $1.2 million, which was the original investment plus 20 percent, as he stated that he invested $1 million for at least eight minutes of screen time and 80 words of dialogue.</p><p>However, in just one line, Dan’s role was reduced to less than a minute. The lawsuit was later withdrawn, as Bilzerian earned $1.5 million in revenue due to the film’s commercial success.</p><p>He was also involved in the brawl in the Miami nightclub; according to Vanessa Castano, when she went to separate two women fighting at the club, she was pushed by Dan and kicked in the face.</p><p>She filed a lawsuit and asked for $1 million to settle the suit foreseeing the chances of punitive damages based on his income if the suit went to trial. Moreover, the police said Dan did not kick, and the case was dropped.</p><p>In 2014, Bilzerian was again in trouble for his act with Janice Griffith, who was set for a photo shoot with him sponsored by the Hustler magazine. He threw the model off the roof into a pool, and she broke her foot as she hit the pool’s edge.</p><p>She asked $85,000 for her injuries, which was rejected. In December, she filed a lawsuit against him and the magazine company. However, his lawyer claimed it was an “act of God” and said it was not his fault.</p><h3>Weapon Controversy</h3><p>In December, Dan was arrested on a fugitive warrant from Nevada at Los Angeles International Airport on unrelated bomb-making charges. As the charges were dropped, he was released but was scheduled to be arraigned in January 2015 in Clark County, Nevada.</p><p>He was fined $17,231.50&nbsp; for a misdemeanor charge of “negligently failing to extinguish a fire in the open.”</p><p>Also, the public criticized him for his behavior during the Las Vegas shooting on October 1, 2017, as he was seen shooting and fleeing to safety, posting videos of himself on Instagram.</p><p>Not only that, but in one of the videos, he also requested a police officer to let him use his guns while on the scene. In his final video, he said, “I don’t think there’s much I can do.”</p><p>Which brought him much criticism for acting insensitively at the unfortunate moment.</p><p>His Ignite president Heffernan sued Bilzerian for wrongful termination in July 2020.</p><p>Heffernan stated that he was fired for criticizing Bilzerian’s misappropriation of company funds for the lavish lifestyle.</p><h3>Unsettled Wealth</h3><p>Bilzerian boasts that his wealth is the outcome of a successful gambling career.</p><p>But many people disagree with him, including poker player Doug Polk. Some of his wealth was inherited from his father, corporate takeover specialist Paul Bilzerian.</p><p>When Paul was asked to pay over $30 million of his allegedly illegal profits to the SEC, he filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and then again in 2001 and did not pay.</p><p>Instead, he set up a trust fund for his two children which they were eligible to take over when they turned 30.</p><p>The 2001 bankruptcy judgment showed that, in 1997, Dan and Adam’s trust was worth $12 million in Cimetrix stock which was meant to be divided between two sons equally.</p><p>According to Curtis Heffernan, Forbes reported that many of his assets were rented by Ignite, the company that Bilzerian founded, and he served as CEO and majority shareholder.</p><h2>Quotes</h2><p>Here are some of Dan Bilzerian’s popular quotes:</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Dan Bilzerian is mainly active on Instagram, but he is also available on Facebook and Twitter.
