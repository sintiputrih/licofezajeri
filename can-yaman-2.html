While she may like it, my mother is a little panicked. “Son, have you changed your mind again?” He would say it every time, but he is proud to see that I am successful. My dad is cooler. “Do whatever you want to do. I have no doubt that he can succeed,” she says. I had no doubts as to whether I would succeed or not.
