It’s been a great ride, and this career has exceeded my wildest hopes,” he said.</p><p>It was a bittersweet night for fans.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, it’s not going to be the same. I mean, you’ve heard his voice for so many years,” said Lisa Brewerton, Blackhawks fan.</p><p>“I like coming to the games, but I love staying home and listening to him. I’m going to miss him a ton,” said Kathy Dolansky, Blackhawks fan.</p><p>The 67-year-old Glenview native is hanging up his headset after a more than 40-year career, 39 of which were with the Blackhawks.</p><p>“When he goes ‘Tree, tree, tree left in the tird,’ that makes me laugh all the time,” Brewerton said.</p><p>Foley was there for the championships but also for the down years. At one point he was even fired by the Blackhawks, only to return seasons later.</p><p>But Foley himself was a constant; generous with his praise, fearless with his criticism, his soaring tenor resonating with honesty.</p><p>“It’s been my pleasure and my honor to try and serve the greatest fans in the world,” Foley said.</p><p>Many say Foley has earned his place on the Mount Rushmore of Chicago sports broadcasters.</p><p>Copyright © 2022 WLS-TV.
