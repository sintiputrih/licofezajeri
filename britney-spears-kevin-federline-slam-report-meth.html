She is the mother of my boys.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Federline, who was married to Spears from 2004 to 2007, slammed the report on his Instagram Story yesterday, calling it “repulsive” and “click bait.” He also criticized Barak’s mention of his and Spears’s two sons, 17-year-old Sean Preston and 16-year-old Jayden James.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It saddens our family that Daphne Barak and [fellow journalist] Erbil Gunasti have decided to fabricate lies and publish the heart ache our family has endured, along with the trauma of our minor children in the Daily Mail and The Sun,” Federline wrote. “We did allow Daphne & Bill into our home because we trusted them, but that trust was lost and we severed ties back in March for many reasons we choose not to go into here. It is very distressing that she continues to harass our family when we have repeatedly asked her to leave us alone.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though he admitted that he and his family have spoken to reporters Barak and Gunasti “a few times,” Federline said “this was done in a respectful way with love & compassion for Britney and the Spears family. The lies and attempts to exploit minors as click bait is another repulsive example of where, unfortunately, certain journalism is today.”</p><img alt="kevin federline instagram story" title="kevin federline instagram story" width=750 height=1334 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-6576-png-6487480978795.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Spears addressed the report in a new Instagram post, in which she expressed her disappointment over her ex-husband and children speaking with journalists about her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The fact that people are claiming things that are not true is so sad ...

So you guys go behind my back and talk about me … it breaks my heart and the news is so low.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added,“Why am I told I have to sit back and rise above ???
