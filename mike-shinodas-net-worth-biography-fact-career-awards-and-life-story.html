When he was 13, Shinoda moved towards playing jazz, blues and hip hop. He attended Agoura High School where he met and formed the band Xero with future Linkin Park bandmates Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon. Shinoda has a bachelor’s degree in graphic design from the Art Center College of Design. He has had a hand in most of Linkin Park’s imagery, including album artwork, band merchandise, web design, and on-stage production art. Shinoda and his bandmates officially formed Linkin Park in 1996. They released their debut album, “Hybrid Theory” in 2000 and rose to international fame. In 2003, Linkin Park released “Meteora” which topped the Billboard 200 album chart. To date the band has sold more than 70 million albums worldwide. Mike has designed much of the band’s album artwork. They were arguably the most-popular rock group of the 2000s. Shinoda formed a side project named Fort Minor between 2003 and 2004 to showcase more of his hip-hop background than he could in the rock band Linkin Park.</p><p><strong>Real Estate</strong>: In October 2019, Mike Shinoda spent $7.95 million on a newly-built mansion in Encino, California.</p><p>In 2006 Mike paid $7.4 million for a home in a gated 90210 community high up in the hills above Sherman Oaks, California.

He sold it in October 2020 for $9 million to hip-hop producer Ernest Dion Wilson, aka “NO ID”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1forassYysn6Kmn5mutHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5waKmoKqRpbW6ecWamq1lk5a%2FprHRZpiwmaKZwG6tzZ1kpaGWmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-stephenson.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Stephenson - Bio, Age, Height, Single, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career</span></a>
