In a season that’s packed with cozy soups and comfort food, they’re a reminder that fresh, seasonal produce is still out there. Asparagus and sweet corn might be months away, but winter greens, root veggies, squash, and citrus are here in full force. A winter salad is the perfect way to show them off. Below, you’ll find 25 of my favorite winter salad recipes. They include something to satisfy any and every salad craving—sweet and savory salads studded with citrus and pears, refreshing green salads, quick slaws, grain salads, lentil salads, and more.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This spinach salad recipe is simple, fresh, and delicious. A version of my mom’s favorite salad, it’s filled with crisp apples, dried cranberries, red onion, creamy goat cheese, and toasty candied pecans. A bright apple cider vinaigrette ties it all together. *Chef’s kiss* This fall, I’ve been making it on repeat. To be totally honest, that’s a bit out of character for me, because I’m not always a fan of spinach salad recipes (something about the texture of the greens, I think). So you should trust me when I say that THIS spinach salad really works.&nbsp;It’s sweet, tangy, and savory,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Good healthy lunch ideas are like gold. In the middle of a busy work day, lunch is the longest break I take. It’s a time to reset, relax, and re-energize to tackle the tasks that lie ahead. Great healthy lunch recipes are ones that I can make ahead of time and that will keep me full and focused throughout the afternoon. But the best&nbsp;healthy lunch ideas taste delicious, too! They add something fun and flavorful to the middle of the work day, making my midday break extra-refreshing and worth looking forward to. Below, you’ll find my top healthy lunch ideas,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Of all the vegetable recipes I post, eggplant recipes are the most divisive. Early on, this surprised me, because eggplant recipes have always been some of my favorite foods to eat. As a kid, I never wanted to stop playing at dinnertime, except when my mom was making eggplant Parmesan. And when I started to explore vegetarian cooking on my own, grilled eggplant was one of the first dishes I mastered. But if I’ve learned one thing through writing Love and Lemons, it’s that not everyone likes eggplant. I’ve heard it called spongy, bitter, and bland, and to that I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This eggplant salad recipe is what you should make after a trip to the farmers market in late summer. It features some of the best produce of the season: eggplant, peppers, cherry tomatoes, and lots of herbs. I love this recipe because it has a delicious blend of raw and cooked ingredients. I grill the eggplant and peppers so that they offer a tender, smoky contrast to the super-fresh tomatoes and herbs. A zingy lemon dressing ties the salad together, while tangy feta cheese and pickled onions take it over the top. Flavorful, refreshing, and bursting with seasonal veggies, this…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Fresh tomato recipes go on repeat in our house every summer. In the dead of winter, there’s nothing I crave more than a summer tomato—sweet, juicy, and ripe. The out-of-season supermarket ones can’t compare, so when summer rolls around, I only have a few months to make every tomato salad, sandwich, pasta, and pizza I’ve imagined throughout the year. When I made my grocery list this morning, I added cherry tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, and&nbsp;tomatoes on the vine. We have lots of tomato recipes on tap this week. 🙂 I hope you’re also cooking with tomatoes like crazy right now, while…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This fattoush salad recipe is the perfect side dish for a summer meal. A Middle Eastern staple, fattoush is fresh and bright, featuring seasonal vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and lettuce, plus a hefty dose of parsley and mint. But, as tasty as tomatoes are in August, the star ingredient in fattoush isn’t a vegetable. It’s bread! That’s right—crispy pita bread adds crunch to this salad, making it pretty darn irresistible for just about anyone. (Salad skeptics, I’m looking at you.) I hope you try this recipe. I think you’ll love it! Fattoush Salad Recipe Ingredients Here’s what you’ll need…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s zucchini season! Bring on the zucchini recipes! Partway through July every summer, I start to feel like I’ve cooked all the zucchini recipes out there. I’ve made zucchini bread and zucchini fritters, grilled zucchini and baked zucchini chips. This week, I looked at my market haul of summer squash and asked, “What next?”. If you’re in a similar spot right now, I have good news: zucchini is one versatile veggie. It tastes fantastic in pastas, tacos, salads, and even chocolate cake! You can grill it, bake it, sauté it, and also eat it raw. We might feel like we’ve…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This cucumber salad recipe is one of the simplest summer side dishes, and if you ask me, it’s also one of the best. It’s versatile. Serve it with any cookout or picnic fare. It’s flavorful. Shout out to the sweet and tangy dressing! And it’s SO refreshing.&nbsp;Just the thing for a hot day. It’s my take on a classic cucumber salad, complete with crisp, cooling cucumbers, red onion, and a punchy vinegar dressing. My special twist? I shower it with dill and chives for a fresh, savory kick. This cucumber salad has definite dill pickle vibes, and I am 100%…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I can’t get enough of this cabbage salad recipe! It’s vibrant and colorful, crunchy and refreshing, made with red and green cabbage, crisp bell peppers, carrots, herbs, and toasty pepitas. But the real star of this cabbage salad recipe is the dressing. It’s a tangy, nutty vinaigrette. A couple tablespoons of peanut butter give it a lightly creamy texture, and apple cider vinegar adds amazing zip. It makes this cabbage salad so lively and unexpected. Serve it as a side dish at your next summer cookout, and everyone will ask for the recipe! Cabbage Salad Recipe Ingredients Here’s what you’ll…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce—fruits and veggies that taste so good on their own that it doesn’t take much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our table with a colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect lunch or dinner: they’re simple to toss together, but they’re super flavorful nonetheless.
