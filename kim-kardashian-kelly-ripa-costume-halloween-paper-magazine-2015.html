While many have tried to imitate Kim’s now iconic magazine cover, nobody did it quite as well as Kelly during the show’s #LIVEHalloween special on Oct. 30.&nbsp;Understandably, Kelly opted to spoof&nbsp;the less risque&nbsp;shot of Kim where she is popping champagne over her head rather than the bare-butt pic&nbsp;that actually did break the Internet. Still, she&nbsp;pulled it off flawlessly, nailing every last detail to perfect! From head-to-toe, Kelly’s&nbsp;costume&nbsp;included every&nbsp;piece of Kim’s cover look, complete with the black sparkly gown, satin gloves, pearl jewelry, and of course, the champagne. She even had&nbsp;the exact hairstyle Kim had with a little spurt of hair sticking out of the bun!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>With such a perfect look, it’s no wonder Kim was fan, taking to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> to congratulate the morning show host on a job well done. “How cute is @KellyRipa!!!! Haha @michaelstrahan you guys nailed it! Happy Halloween!” she wrote alongside a screen shot of the two in their costumes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Of course, this was hardly&nbsp;the first time Kelly has imitated&nbsp;Kim. Last year, she and her Live&nbsp;co-host <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Michael Strahan</a>&nbsp;</strong>dressed up in&nbsp;Kimye’s wedding look, totally mocking Kim’s big booty and Kanye’s “cleavage.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As if Kelly’s bootylicious costume wasn’t Halloween perfection enough, she also debuted a number of other hilarious looks throughout the course of the show&nbsp;— each one better than the last.&nbsp;She transformed&nbsp;a hairy-chested man for a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Magic Mike</a> look, sported side buns as <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Star Wars</a>‘&nbsp;Princess Leia (which she dressed as to kick off the show), and even&nbsp;rocked a <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Donald Trump</a></strong> outfit! Honestly, we can’t imagine how she’ll be able to top these next year (although, we have all the confidence in the world that she will).</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Do you think Kelly’s Kim costume was&nbsp;perfect, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
