He has appeared on several episodes of Chrisley Knows Best, but most recently, he helped his best friend chaperone the dance Nanny Faye and her sister attended.</p><p>He lists himself as an actor and comedian, both things he appears to be serious about. Back when Todd Chrisley filmed scenes at the <a href=#>Juice Bar</a>, Ronndell Smith was featured as the comedian for the opening. He is definitely a funny guy, but he hasn’t really broken into the business quite yet.</p><p></p><p>Chase Chrisley refers to himself and his two friends, Parker and Ronndell as the three stooges, a nod to the comedic trio that made people laugh several decades ago. The three of them together certainly cause quite the headache for Todd Chrisley.</p><p>As Ronndell Smith attempts to get his career going, he has been given the Chrisley Knows Best platform to reach people. Fans of the show have followed him on social media, but his big break is yet to come.</p><p>If you are looking for comedic relief for a party or an event, <a href=#>Ronndell Smith</a> is available to hire. He is based out of Georgia, which is likely why he isn’t seen on the show much. The Chrisleys have moved to Nashville so logistics aren’t as easy as they used to be.</p><p>Chrisley Knows Best fans adore Ronndell Smith, especially when he is causing trouble with Chase Chrisley.</p><p>Chrisley Knows Best airs its 100th episode on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 p.m. EST on the&nbsp;USA network.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6edvG610mapqKaembKtuIyspKKsmGK8r3nCoamiq5yaxm63zaiurGWSmsC1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-harry-o-harris-net-worth-2024-2.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Harry O Harris Net Worth 2024</span></a>
