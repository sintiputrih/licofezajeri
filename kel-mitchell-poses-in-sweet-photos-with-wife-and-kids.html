He instead spoke with his dad via Facetime. “Got thoughtful gifts and @therealasialee also got me Jerk chicken with coconut rice and beans, plantains, and steamed cabbage,” Kel said of the manner by which he was spoiled by his family. “Introduced the kids to the original muppet movie from 1979 a classic! We also had random dance breaks throughout the day,” Mitchell went on to describe his special day. “Honor broke out a serious spin move today! Truly Grateful!”</p><p><a href=#>Kel Mitchell</a> became a father 23 years ago when he welcomed his son, Lyric Mitchell, with his then-wife Tyisha Hampton. Kel’s oldest daughter, Allure Mitchell, was born two years later in October 2001. The actor’s younger children, Honor and Wisdom, came years later after Kel divorced Tyisha and married his current wife, Asia Lee.</p><p>“Grateful, excited, and blessed to spend another Father’s Day with YOU @iamkelmitchell,” Asia wrote to her husband this past weekend. “A Very Happy Father’s Day to My Forever,” Mrs. Mitchell shared. Kel responded to the love from his wife with a beautiful note of gratitude.</p><p>“Thank you, my love,” the actor wrote to his wife. “You always make Father’s Day so special for me,” <a href=#>Kel</a> told Asia. “You make every day special,” he added. “Love you forever! Grateful!”</p><p>Asia Lee and Kel Mitchell celebrate ten years of marriage this year. Their oldest child, Wisdom, celebrates her fifth birthday next month. Honor, the couple’s son, turns 2-years-old in October.</p><p>Photo: Asia Lee Mitchell/Instagram</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>358</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOpJylZZ2ewaS0xKWjZqifqLK0ecinZKyvlZrBbrzHqKuoq12strW0jLCgn51dlrulecqim6xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kayla-williams-net-worth-160191.html><span>←</span><span>Kayla Williams Net Worth</span></a>
