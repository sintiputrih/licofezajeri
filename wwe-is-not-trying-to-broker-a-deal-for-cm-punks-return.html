Consequently, he made the bold decision to walk away from WWE, and for the next seven years, he refrained from stepping into the ring. However, in 2021, Punk resurfaced in the world of professional wrestling, making his highly anticipated debut in AEW. There are also rumors that he&nbsp;was negotiating a return with WWE. However, it seems those rumors have been laid to rest recently.</p><p>CM Punk became embroiled in a controversial situation that took a turn for the worse after the altercation that transpired at AEW All Out. In the aftermath, fans have been speculating about Punk’s future with the company, and whether he might depart from AEW and potentially return to WWE.</p><p>There have been recent rumors, albeit from unverified sources, that Ace Steel was present at the Royal Rumble last month and that his attendance may have been related to discussions about CM Punk potentially rejoining WWE.</p><p>Ace Steel played a significant role in CM Punk’s early training and development as a wrestler, and the two have maintained a close relationship throughout the years. Punk also reportedly played a part in AEW’s decision to hire Steel after he was released by WWE last year.</p><p>According to the latest&nbsp;<a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, Dave Meltzer shot down those rumors. Meltzer explained Punk joining WWE wouldn’t be possible at this point as he’s still under contract with AEW, adding that the claim that Steel was at Royal Rumble was also false.</p><p>There were reports going around regarding Chris Guy (Ace Steel) being at the Royal Rumble and then speculating that he was there to broker a deal for C.M. Punk. However, not only is that impossible at this point because Punk is under contract to AEW, but Guy wasn’t at the Rumble to begin with so that aspect of the story was incorrect from the start.</p><p>It was also noted that, “Guy worked with WWE as a producer from 2019 to April 2020 when he was furloughed due to COVID cutbacks, hired back in October 2020 before being let go at the start of 2022 where Punk got him into AEW.” So, no, WWE is not close to bringing in CM Punk.</p><p>CM Punk’s possible WWE return is also&nbsp;<a href=#>greatly opposed within the company.&nbsp;</a>Triple H was also&nbsp;<a href=#>strongly warned against signing CM Punk</a>. Regardless, we’ll have to see what will become of CM Punk in the end.</p><p><strong>Do you think CM Punk will return to WWE?
