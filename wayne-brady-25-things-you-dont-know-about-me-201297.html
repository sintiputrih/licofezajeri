Benefits, you know.</p><p><strong>24.</strong> I made my sister's Teddy Ruxpin talk as Satan for two weeks so she'd do my chores.</p><p><strong>23.</strong> I was in a gang for a week. We stole Peanut M&Ms and comic books from the 7-11. Gangsta.</p><p><strong>22. </strong>In the same gang, I fought a Haitian kid at school and he tried to stab me with a pencil. I beat his a– with a backpack . . .filled with M&Ms and comic books. Then I quit the gang.</p><p><strong>21.</strong> I sold sponges, soap, coloring books, and inspirational tapes door to door when I was 15.</p><p><strong>20.</strong> Worked at Kaybee Toys once for 2 weeks to get the employee discount so I could buy a Nintendo game system.</p><p><strong>19.</strong> I helped open an Improv comedy theater in Orlando, Florida that's still there called Sak Comedy Theatre. Go see them and ask for the Wayne Brady discount. I hope they let you in.</p><p><strong>18.</strong> I was a lounge singer in Tokyo, Japan.</p><p><strong>17.</strong> I took the cake from a birthday party where I was playing the Black Power Ranger, when the dad said "I'm not paying you crap! You don't do karate!" Poor little Jorge…</p><p><strong>16.</strong> I'm a neat freak.</p><p><strong>15. </strong>I'm a Grammy nominated singer with a Top Five Urban AC single called "Ordinary".</p><p><strong>14. </strong>I'm a video game addict. PS3, Xbox 360, PC gaming, The Wii, Sony Vida! It's my crack!</p><p><strong>13.</strong> I like shoes. A lot. 200 pair.</p><p><strong>12.</strong> I'm a mama's boy.</p><p><strong>11.</strong> I was Ritchie in one of the most horrible productions of A Chorus Line ever.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> I was cast as one of the original Simbas in The Lion King.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> I have a very ugly big toe on my left foot.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> I'm very introverted in person unless I've known you for years. Then it's on!</p><p><strong>7.</strong> I'm allergic to cats. I had an allergic reaction on a date and had to go to the ER. Insert joke involving pussy cats . . .here.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> My business partner, co-music manger, and best friend is my ex wife.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>If we're going to date, you may have to be cool with number 6.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Blazing Saddles is my favorite movie. Ever.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. </strong>I haven't any patience at all, especially with myself.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>My mother knew nothing about numbers 22 and 23 until she read this. Thanks, US Weekly.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> I've never actually "choked a b—h," but hey, I'm still young!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6asZ6aeqO%2BwJ2wZmplYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6pbvNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqWVYn9xfZFybmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./talia-jackson-bio-age-parents-wikipedia-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Talia Jackson Bio: Age, Parents, Wikipedia and Net Worth</span></a>
