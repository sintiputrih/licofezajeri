This happened in the 1700 block of Richlandtown Pike, close to Keystone Road, in Springfield Township. The driver, Owen Orser, who was 23 years old, was taken to the hospital. Sadly, he was declared deceased about an hour later. </strong>The coroner of Bucks County, Meredith Buck, shared this information. The man, who lived in Hilltown Township, had his death determined to be an accident, according to the authorities.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The state police mentioned that Orser was driving too quickly given the road conditions, especially while navigating a curve.
