<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Are DC Animated Movies Better Than Their Live-Action Movies?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The world of animation has opened up an incredible amount of possibilities for the biggest franchises on the big and small screen. These animated shows and movies are able to bring something unique to the table and please fans looking for something a little bit different. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DC</a></strong>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a> have all tapped into the animation game, and DC has been exceptional with their movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, people have had a number of criticisms&nbsp;about the DCEU, but it seems as though their animated films get a lot more love overall. Of course, there are pros and cons to both formats, but it is worth looking to see if their animated films are, in fact, better than their live-action movies.</p><p>Let’s take a look and break it down!</p><h2 id=the-animated-movies-tap-into-a-variety-of-source-material>The Animated Movies Tap Into A Variety Of Source Material</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/264D7FFD-F9F1-4666-9FBD-AE5DD6D3D3AA.jpeg><p>When breaking down some of the primary differences between the animated movies and the live-action films, one thing that most fans&nbsp;will quickly point out is at the animated movies are able to tap into a wealth of source material. Because of this, DC animated movies get to touch on a lot more stories when compared to their live-action counterparts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Making a live-action movie is tough because any source material that is utilized needs to be condensed down in a way that can fit the overall narrative, and sometimes, we do see films utilize threads from multiple stories to bring out the best movie&nbsp;possible. However, when it comes to the animated movies, the teams bringing them to life are able to just focus on one particular story and make any necessary changes that they see fit.</p><p>Because of this, fans of the comics get a chance to see their favorite stories come out on a more regular basis and it also gives an opportunity for those unfamiliar with the source material to familiarize themselves with classic DC stories. This is a huge advantage for the animated flicks, and it is a legitimate&nbsp;reason people keep coming back for more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While being able to tap into a seemingly limitless amount of source material for the animated movies is huge, there is a negative factor that needs to be addressed, as everyone in the business knows that dollars make sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Cackling At The Bad Special Effects In ‘Wonder Woman 1984’</a></span></p><h2 id=the-live-action-movies-make-loads-of-cash>The Live-Action Movies Make Loads Of Cash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F75CC3F5-CD0E-4C5E-B23D-DC3A517966FE.jpeg><p>It shouldn’t come off as too much of a surprise to learn that the live-action movies that wind up getting a big screen release end up generating considerably more money than the animated movies do.</p><p>In the past, we have seen DC&nbsp;movies&nbsp;like Aquaman cross the $1 billion mark at the box office, which is something that no DC animated movie will ever come close to matching. Even other hit DC films like&nbsp;Wonder Woman, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Suicide Squad all pull down hundreds of millions of dollars more than the animated movies could ever dream of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What this shows is that, while animated movies do have an advantage of utilizing virtually any source material they want, most people are going to be inclined to watch a live-action movie in theaters. This is an advantage that cannot be stressed enough, as making money is always the name of the game in the business.</p><p>Sure, not every movie that rakes in a fortune at the box office is great, but there is something to be said about the fact that DC can basically print money when one of their biggest characters is involved in a movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Robert Pattinson Has To Do To Prepare For The Batman</a></span></p><h2 id=the-rotten-tomatoes-verdict>The Rotten Tomatoes Verdict</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20DB68E5-E33F-4DC9-AF03-9D52529ED9EB.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of movies being great, another thing we want to examine here is what the critics think about these movies. The animated movies and the live-action films in the DCEU are not always praised, but it is interesting to see which films have gotten the most acclaim over time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Actors Who’ve Played The Most Superheroes</a></span></p><p>According to Rotten Tomatoes, there have only been two DCEU movies that have been able to crack <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 90%</a> on the site. Wonder Woman and Shazam were both exceptional offerings for&nbsp;the big screen, but outside of that, things get a little shaky. Yes, the company has hit grand slams with other&nbsp;releases like Joker, but when solely looking at the DCEU, it’s not all that pretty.</p><p>As far as the animated movies,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flashpoint Paradox</a> sits at the top with a sterling 100% on the site.&nbsp;Justice League Dark: Apokolips War&nbsp;also has a perfect score, along with&nbsp;Batman vs. Robin and&nbsp;Batman: Bad Blood. In this department, the animated movies win, hands down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DC has a lot going for it with the animated and live-action movies, and really, it’s all going to come down to preference. Even then, be sure to get a little bit of both.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Two Batman Universe: How It Will Unfold?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dmbBurc2ipJqslZl6rrvVopysZZKawbWx0WaroZmeYsGpscirZKWhppp6oq%2FToqanZZ2kw6qx0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-season-of-the-sticks-mean.html><span>←</span><span>What Does Season of the Sticks Mean?
