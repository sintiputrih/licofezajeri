<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Passive HDX-2 and Watercooled HDX-3</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>This week Alphacool announced the availability of their new M.2 SSD Coolers, the HDX-2 and HDX-3. Some may recall the original HDX M.2 cooler was a simple, passive, clip on heatsink for M.2 SSDs, and was designed to help prevent thermal throttling which has a tendency to plague synthetic test results on some M.2 based drives. With the advent of the HDX-2 and HDX-3, they have moved beyond the simple clip cooler and to using a PCIe x4 card. This design change allowed&nbsp;a full sized heatsink&nbsp;to be mounted on it giving more surface area to cool the attached M.2 device. The HDX-3 takes the HDX-2 and its passive setup a step further and uses&nbsp;a waterblock instead of the large heatsink to remove the heat created from these SSDs.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/11647/hdx2small_l_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>&nbsp;<a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/11647/hdx3small_r_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The dimensions both the of HDX-2 come in at 100 x 81.5 x 20 mm with the HDX-3 being slightly taller at 120 mm while&nbsp;sharing the same width and height.&nbsp;According to Alphacool, the included 4x PCIe card allows a maximum bandwidth of around 3900 MB/s. Existing&nbsp;M.2 drives on the market will not be able to saturate it. Though it is double sided, both M.2 coolers hold&nbsp;one M.2 based device. Contact from the M.2 device to the&nbsp;heatsink is provided by included thermal pads. These thermals pads cover both single and double sided M.2 drives. The HDX-2 and HDX-3 both support up to one&nbsp;80mm M.2 SSD. Both devices connect to the PCIe slot and mount to the case&nbsp;for a stable platform.&nbsp;</p><table border=0 width=100%><tbody readability=1><tr readability=2><td class=contentwhite colspan=3>Alphacool HDX-2 and HDX-3 M.2 SSD Coolers</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td>Technical Data</td><td>HDX-2</td><td>HDX-3</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Dimensions (LxWxH)</td><td>100 x 81.5 x 20 mm</td><td>120 x 81.5 x 20 mm</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Material</td><td>Aluminum</td><td>Copper, Acetal</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Threads</td><td>N/A</td><td>2x G 1/4"</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>PCIe Form Factor</td><td colspan=2 rowspan=1>PCIe 3.0 x4</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Compatibility</td><td colspan=2 rowspan=1>M.2 2280 PCIe SSDs</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Max.

The heatsinks are black with αCOOL and HDX-2&nbsp;stenciled&nbsp;on it in white as well as having cooling fins to increase cooling area - the heatsinks&nbsp;cover&nbsp;the&nbsp;entire&nbsp;PCB of the PCIe card. The drive is mounted to the PCB, thermal pads applied to the drive, then mount the heatsink to the board.&nbsp;</p><p>The HDX-3 block is made of nickel-plated copper with the top made from a single piece of acetal. The block mounts to one side of the PCIe card leaving the other side open. Alphacool says water flows over the entire SSD to help keep things cool. The water enters and exits the block at the opposite end to the PCIe connector using standard G ¼” a threads.&nbsp;</p><p>Pricing and availability were not listed in the press release.&nbsp;</p><h3>Related Reading</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5ygpNwZpqkoJ2upLvOpWSrnZyarrSx0marsKddo7K4edKsm2abn6S5pr7SZquhnV2dsbl%2BjJqlnWWYmcV0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justjordan33-2.html><span>←</span><span>JustJordan33 Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
