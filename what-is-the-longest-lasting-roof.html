The expected service life of a 30-year product, if properly cared for, is approximately 25 years. If it's not cared for properly, that 30 year shingle will only last 12 to 15 years. That's one of the big misconceptions in the roofing marketplace.<h2>Is there such a thing as a 50 year roof?</h2>Standard asphalt shingles—the most common roofing material—lasts about 15 years.

That means you can expect to get about 20-22 years out of your 3-tab shingle roof and 25-28 years out of your dimensional shingles.<h2>Are impact resistant shingles worth the money?</h2>The truth of the matter is that impact resistant shingles can cost you as much as 100 percent more than a standard asphalt shingled roof installation. The impact resistant shingle roof will cost more at installation time, but over the year, with less repairs needed, it is a money saver.<h2>Which is better shingles or metal?</h2>Top Benefits of Metal Roofing Compared to Shingles<p>Metal roofing is durable and routinely lasts 2-4 times longer than shingles.
