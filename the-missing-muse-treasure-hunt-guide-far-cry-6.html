Treasure Hunts are special missions that send you on a search for clues and items that will eventually lead you to a reward. The Missing Muse is all about a poet and his lost love, and players will need to track down some poetry paragraphs to solve this one.</p><p data-injection=true>Players should begin by heading to the Treasure Hunt marker for the mission. They will find a small red book on the wall of a shack. Reading it will reveal the love been a poet called Ambrosia and his love, Rosa.</p><p>Nearby, players will be able to see a large building built from an old boat. Head up the stairs and walk around to the front, where you will find a key hanging on the wall. There is a board covered in numbers, and the one with a key is strangely blank.</p><p data-injection=true>From there, walk across the pier to the large stilted hut, where you will find a poem at the top of it. The poem speaks of a cliff, and you can see a small outcrop of rock directly ahead. Take the zipline across, then you will find another poem at the top of the cliff.</p><p>The poem describes how Rosa is actually a boat that sank. Dive off the cliff and swim down into the water to find Rosa at the bottom of the sea. At the rear of the ship is a chest that you can open with the key to get the Tech Mask.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4d686f5b0a45b38d7d7ce44dbe2ea347?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Aidan O'Brien</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Aidan O'Brien has been playing games for over three decades and has been writing about them for five years.
