During lockdown in 2020, the pair reconnected in a group text, which then led to FaceTime chats, and eventually to lengthy Zoom calls every night. "We didn't sit in the same room for almost four months, but we spoke to each other everyday," Duffy said while appearing alongside Purl on "This Morning" on January 26 (via the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>). Purl acknowledged that quarantine played a large part in their romance. "I don't think it would have happened otherwise because in our normal lives pre-pandemic, we wouldn't have had three hours to Zoom, but we did," she said. The "Knots Landing" actor described Purl as "the most beautiful thing in the world" on the morning talk show. "I wasn't looking for [love] but it found me ... I'm in an incredibly happy relationship," he added.</p><p dir=ltr>Their relationship was tested when the pair were cast as a couple for a Lifetime movie that was filmed in Vancouver, and they were forced to quarantine together. "It was a time to really get to know one another with no outside influences to encumber you," Duffy told <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> in 2021. The actor fawned over his romantic partner and co-star. "I am stunned every time that I realize this amazing woman loves me. It's just like, wow!" he exclaimed.</p><p dir=ltr>Meanwhile, Purl never misses an opportunity to post an adorable snap with Duffy on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> page, which is littered with photos of her beau.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG1gZYV3e8%2Baq6uhk6B6pcHFn7Bmm5GjwW6%2F06inZp%2BcpMSqusZmmJunpal6qbXSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWnnsGpecuipZ2ZXaXCs7iO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./one-in-five-young-americans-thinks-the-holocaust-is-a-myth.html><span>←</span><span>One in five young Americans thinks the Holocaust is a myth</span></a>
