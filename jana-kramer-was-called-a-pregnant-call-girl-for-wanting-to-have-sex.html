I’ve got some testosterone going through my body. ‘So I’m like, ‘Let’s go.’ … I want to have sex all the time.”</p><p>Kramer added on Wednesday that the Internet can be “the worst” for the backlash, to which Caussin replied, “I know, right?”</p><p>As for any updates in the bedroom since earlier this month, Kramer laughed and told Us that the twosome are “good” in that department. Despite all the sex talk, the “I Got the Boy” crooner also told Us that she and Caussin <a href=#>will not be having a third child</a> — at least not biologically.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jana-Kramer-and-Mike-Caussin.jpg><p>“I’m gonna be 35 in December and after 35 it’s basically a geriatric pregnancy,” she explained. “I wanna be done. I wanna live the rest of my thirties getting in shape and just taking care. We wanna adopt too.”</p><p>Kramer and Caussin, who tied the knot in May 2015, are also parents of 2-year-old daughter Jolie. The duo separated in 2016 after Us Weekly exclusively revealed that the former NFL star was <a href=#>unfaithful</a> to his wife, but they later reconciled.</p><p>Reporting by Taylor Ferber</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ6Weqy%2BwKacq2WnlsBur8Clo56cXZZ6sb7EoKWapqRisKK4y2aeoqqcYrOwvoywmKesmaO0bsDOZp%2BarpViwKbEjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flo-rida-son-accident-zohar-dillard-fell.html><span>←</span><span>Flo Rida Son Accident- 6 Years Old Zohar Dillard Fell From Window</span></a>
