She loved open clothes, skater or Converse shoes, and bracelets. She opted for “old, crumpled T’s” over “glittery get-ups” for photoshoots. Her style and musical tastes earned her the moniker “pop-punk princess.”</p><p>She was called the “anti-Britney” by the press and fans for her less commercial and “authentic” look, but also for her obvious stubbornness. “They must call me the anti-Britney since I am not made up and am not told what to say or do.” By November 2002, Lavigne had dropped her ties, claiming she felt “disguised.” Throughout her career, Lavigne has chosen to put her music first.</p><p>Assailing her compositional abilities, Lavigne’s second album collaborator Chantal Kreviazuk said in the year 2007 that “Avril doesn’t really sit down and compose songs alone or anything.” Avril Lavigne denied it and considered suing Kreviazuk for “clear slander.” “Avril is a great songwriter, and it has been a pleasure to work with her,” said Kreviazuk afterward.</p><p>Avril Lavigne’s publishing company and Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald were sued shortly after for allegedly plagiarizing “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend” for her song “Girlfriend.” Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, “I composed it with Avril… It uses ten Blink-182 songs’ chord progressions, with Sum 41 changes. The Sex Pistols, not Rubinoos.” A secret agreement ended the lawsuit in January 2008.</p><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Duffy Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)"><img data-expand=600 width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/duffy-1-1-150x150.jpg alt data-pin-nopin=true data-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Duffy Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Kurt Hugo Schneider Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)"><img data-expand=600 width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kurt-Hugo-Schneider-1-1-150x150.jpg alt data-pin-nopin=true data-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Kurt Hugo Schneider Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Rihanna Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)"><img data-expand=600 width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rihanna-1-1-150x150.jpg alt data-pin-nopin=true data-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Rihanna Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Alison Sudol Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)"><img data-expand=600 width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Alison-Sudol-1-1-150x150.jpg alt data-pin-nopin=true data-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Alison Sudol Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunCt1augpWWclsOqs82eZGtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khaddi-sagnia.html><span>←</span><span>Khaddi Sagnia</span></a>
