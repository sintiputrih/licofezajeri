With Steve-O” podcast</a> on July 30. “I met Common when I was filming my movie The Kitchen, he was in it. He was, I guess, kind of like my love interest. I made out with him in the movie and we became friends but it wasn’t anything sexual … because my eyes were set on something else.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tiffany-Haddish-Confirms-Shes-Dating-Common.jpg><p>Haddish and the Chicago native, 48, first sparked romance rumors when they teamed up for a <a href=#>virtual dating</a> campaign for Bumble in April. The next month, the <a href=#>Like a Boss</a> star seemingly confirmed that she was quarantined with the rapper amid the global health crisis when they appeared together on an Instagram Live with friends <a href=#><strong>Dwyane Wade</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Gabrielle Union</strong></a>. The pair was spotted together once more in June while attending a <a href=#>Black Lives Matter protest</a> in Los Angeles.</p><p>“I got on Bumble, like, May of last year,” Haddish added on the podcast. “Then Bumble approached me about doing something and I had been talking to Common, he’d come and play Spades with me and my friends. I mentioned it to him … and at this point our friendship was getting a little more than friendship, but not quite.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tiffany-Haddish-Confirms-Shes-Dating-Common-2.jpg><p>After spending time together on video calls, the duo decided to <a href=#>put their budding romance to the test</a> and hunker down together during the pandemic. Though it’s still early on in their relationship, Haddish has high hopes for her future with the <a href=#>Oscar winner</a>.</p><p>“This is hands down the best relationship I’ve ever been in. Knock on wood!” she gushed. “I’ve lost 20 pounds since I’ve been in this relationship. I feel more confident in me and it’s not him that’s doing it. I’m just way happier and it’s like knowing I got somebody that cares about me, that really has my back. It seems like he does anyways. And I love it. I love him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Girls Trip actress was previously married to <strong>William Stewart</strong> from 2011 to 2013. Common, for his part, shares 23-year-old daughter <strong>Omoye Assata Lynn</strong> with a former girlfriend. While testing the waters of their relationship, the new couple has learned to appreciate every aspect of each other apart from their celebrity status.</p><p>“This is my first time ever dating a celebrity,” Haddish said on the podcast. “I f–ked one, but this is my first time dating one [and] <a href=#>being in a relationship</a> with one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZabrq%2FFjKGYnZyZqLVur86nnaKqnah6tLTErGSdmaSeu6h5wqikpqeeYrZuuM6vnGagmaJ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nala-ryan-dyrdek.html><span>←</span><span>Nala Ryan Dyrdek - Bio, Age, Single, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career</span></a>
