"Basically, what we're doing in the episode is we are not telling you yet, or maybe not at all, how that character died," said Ryan Murphy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aef2881b6067-cory-z.jpg><p id=evb9cmVboOhi data-wc=69>One thing is for certain though, Cory's character Finn will not meet his end with an accidental drug overdose in the same way it is thought the actor did in real life. "At one point, we were going to have his character die after an accidental drug overdose — that was something we had considered. "But we have decided that we're not going to have him pass from that."</p><p id=eAE7XzcgaeR data-wc=43><a class=hm-link href=#>A tribute episode</a> which is intended as a celebration of the character's life is being filmed this week. "That might be weird for some people, but it felt really exploitative to do it any other way," Ryan explained to in an interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d2c4ecfcf8b-glee-z.jpg><p id=eonDs3K0Voef data-wc=76>Fox's Chairman of Entertainment, Kevin Reilly, has confirmed earlier this month that the special episode — airing on 10 October in memory of Cory — will "deal directly with the incidents involved in Cory's passing and the drug abuse in particular. "Ryan also plans to shoot PSAs — public service announcements — with cast members in character. "They're going to speak directly to the audience and I think they're going to be very impactful," explained Ryan.</p><p id=e3evHisf-9 data-wc=50>Despite Cory's relapse earlier this year, which forced him to enter rehab in March, Kevin admitted that his tragic death still came as a shock. "You see some people struggling with addiction and it's clear. Cory was a big, open, wonderful life force. He was not a problem," he said.</p><p id=eUgXM8m7IA data-wc=23>The 31-year-old heartthrob was found dead in a hotel room in Vancouver, Canada last month of "a mixed-drug toxicity involving heroin and alcohol."</p><p id=eGUnK9jeEQ data-wc=37>The service added that Cory's death was unlikely to have been intentional, saying, "It should be noted that at this point there is no evidence to suggest Mr Monteith's death was anything other than a most-tragic accident."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
