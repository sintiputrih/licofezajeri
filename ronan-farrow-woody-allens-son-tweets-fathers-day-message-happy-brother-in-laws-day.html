We’ve covered Ronan Farrow, Woody Allen and Mia Farrow’s 24 year-old biological son, just twice. Ronan is a good-looking and incredibly accomplished guy in his own right. The first time we covered him was to announce that he got a high level position in the State Department. Ronan is just 24 now, and he graduated from Yale Law School at 21 and was named a Rhodes Scholar last year."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Ronan is a good-looking and incredibly accomplished guy in his own right. The first time we covered him was to <a href=#>announce that he got a high level position in the State Department</a>. Ronan is just 24 now, and he graduated from Yale Law School at 21 and was named a Rhodes Scholar last year. He describes himself on Twitter as a “Writer, human rights lawyer and diplomat, most recently Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues.”</p><p>So he has an impressive resume and an important career. That doesn’t mean he’s immune to family drama, and his family drama is worse than most. The <a href=#>last time we covered Ronan</a> the National Enquirer was reporting that he was “disgusted by [his dad] Woody [Allen] and his relationship with Soon Yi.” You surely know the background on this, but I’ll just quickly recap: Soon Yi was adopted by Mia Farrow and her ex husband, Andre Previn, when she was eight. (Here’s <a href=#>a link with more background</a> on Mia’s family and her many kids.) When she was 21, it was revealed that Soon Yi was having a relationship with her mother’s then-partner of 12 years, Woody Allen. Woody and Mia of course split up, Soon Yi went on to marry Woody in 1997 and they’re still together. All of this has never sat well with Woody and Mia’s son, Ronan. He’s <a href=#>previously said of Allen</a>: “He’s my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.”</p><p><a href=#>In a new tweet</a>, Ronan repeated that same sentiment. It’s clear he’s still estranged from his dad, and he’s poking fun at that.<br><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ronantwitter.jpg alt title=ronantwitter width=518 height=189 sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Can you imagine your dad marrying your damn sister? There’s no free pass for that, other then legally (which I guess is all that counts to Allen), because she’s adopted. Hollywood forgives a lot of things that seem unforgivable, don’t they?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wenn3944732-726x1024.jpg alt title="Soon Yi Previn and Woody Allen" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wenn3944722-756x1024.jpg alt="Soon Yi Previn and Woody Allen" title="Soon Yi Previn and Woody Allen" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>General Wesley Clark with Mia and Ronan<br><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/miaronanweslezclarke.jpg alt title=miaronanweslezclarke width=648 height=484 sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>photo of Soon Yi and Woody Allen credit: WENN.com.
