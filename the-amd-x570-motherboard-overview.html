There is RGB LED lighting built into the heatsink, with a strip underneath the right-hand side of the PCB for an ambient styled glow. In terms of storage, the ASUS ROG Strix X570-I Gaming has eight SATA ports and two PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 slots; one is located on the front just above the full-length PCIe 4.0 x16 slot which includes a heatsink, while the other sits on the rear of the boards PCB.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Aimed at the mid to high-end gamers, the ASUS ROG Strix X570-I Gaming has a ROG SupremeFX S1220 HD audio codec which powers three 3.5 mm audio jacks, with three USB 3.1 G2 Type-A, one USB 3.1 G2 Type-C, and four USB 3.1 G1 Type-A ports also on the rear panel. Interestingly ASUS includes a DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 pairing of video outputs on the rear for use with the newly announced <a href=#>AMD Ryzen 3000 series APUs</a>.
