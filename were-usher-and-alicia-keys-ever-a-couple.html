Even the most committed football fan would have trouble denying that Usher’s halftime show at the 2024 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl</a> was one for the books, complete with far-too-evocative-looking pianos, proof of just how situational a shirt can be, and a hearty dose of the one and only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alicia Keys</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>We all know the rules of the internet by now: since Keys and Usher were seen in close proximity to one another, it’s only natural that we all begin to wonder very loudly if the two have any romantic history. Well, with respect to that inquiry, I stand before you all as I prepare to take far too much joy in bursting this particular bubble.</p><h2 id=h-were-usher-and-alicia-keys-ever-in-a-relationship data-injectable=false>Were Usher and Alicia Keys ever in a relationship?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/alicia-keys-usher-2024-super-bowl.jpg><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>By all accounts, Usher and Alicia Keys have never found themselves falling down the same romantic hole together. They did, however, once join artistic forces for the Billboard Hot 100 charter “My Boo,” a duet they released in 2004, which perhaps explains the apparent comfort they have with one another. For those of you who didn’t already know that, however, I’m sure that’s just made you even more suspicious about Usher’s and Alicia Keys’ personal, intimate lives.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>If so, I’m sorry to say that I can’t help you there. I do not personally know Usher or Alicia Keys, and even if I did, I would probably still get very little nutritious mileage out of any information regarding whether or not they are or ever have been romantically involved (i.e. about as much mileage as you’re getting right now).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEpr7EZqysoJWneqK6w2aYpaGTnq5ut8Syqmadppq%2Fbq2MnKauqJyafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-brady-girlfriend-is-he-dating-irina-shayk-dating-history-and-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Brady Girlfriend: Is He Dating Irina Shayk?
