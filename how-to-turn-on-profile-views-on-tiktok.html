Wanting to find out if your bestie really did watch your vid of the latest dance trend? Or maybe you might be worried that someone out there is paying a little too much attention to your account. Help is on the way. Using TikTok‚Äôs Profile View is a great way to find out just who is viewing your TikTok profile.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>that profile views on tik tok be exposing people already üòÇüòÇ</p>‚Äî alina (@ahhliinaa) <a href=#>April 16, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>TikTok is now in the process of reintroducing its Profile View feature, which has been absent since 2020. So if the feature isn‚Äôt on your dashboard yet, just be patient. It should roll around within the next few updates. Once it arrives, you should be able to use the function to find out exactly who is viewing your profile. Mostly. More on that later. First let us show you how to use the feature.</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>First, open TikTok and tap on your profile icon. Next, tap the eye symbol in the top bar of the screen. Select ‚ÄúTurn On,‚Äù and that‚Äôs it, you‚Äôve set up the Profile View functionality. Now you‚Äôll be able to use the tool to find out anyone who has viewed your profile in the past 30 days. The app will also send you a notification that will inform you when someone has viewed your profile. (Careful ‚è§ if you happen to be lucky enough to have a very successful account, you may find yourself flooded with notifications).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love the new tik tok update , showing me who views my profile and it‚Äôs all my haters üò≠</p>‚Äî Miss. IDGAFüíã (@ariyalaa) <a href=#>April 18, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>You can also check the list of who viewed your profile yourself by just tapping the eye icon on your profile tab. This will take you to your visitor history page and show you a list of anyone who has stopped by to check you out.</p><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>However, there are a few catches. First of all, the function only records the views of users that have enabled the function themselves. If they don‚Äôt have profile view on for their own account, they won‚Äôt show up in your history. Conversely, if you have your function off, other accounts won‚Äôt be able to see if you‚Äôve visited their profile page. In other words, if you opt in, you‚Äôre visible but can see your visitors. If you opt out, you‚Äôre invisible but can‚Äôt see if anybody is paying too much attention to your account.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>So, if you decide you want to return to anonymity, just repeat the turning-on process, only this time choose the ‚ÄúTurn Off‚Äù option. Don‚Äôt worry. You can switch back and forth between the options as often as you want.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=535 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>If Instagram starts doing profile views like Tik Tok then we‚Äôre all doomed</p>‚Äî Leah (@LeahLNurse) <a href=#>April 18, 2022</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekmrCpe8eormasn2LBtr7NZqanZaCnvKe1y55kr6GVrMBuu81mq6KjpKS4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-steve-harwell-net-worth-fortune-explored-smash-mouth-lead-singer-dies-aged-56.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Fortune explored as Smash Mouth lead singer dies aged 56</span></a>
