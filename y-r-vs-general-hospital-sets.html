I saw 39 sets in four or five weeks! I didn’t count but I don’t think Y&R even had 39 in the last 12 months, and that’s including sets that were used one time or two or three times for a specific story.</p><p>No one is holding business meetings in people’s living rooms. They’re not having business meetings and private conversations in a hotel lobby where everyone can hear. People actually live in houses that you see!</p><p>And there are sets for recreation!! A garage, a horse stable with a real horse, a nail salon, a swimming pool that people actually use, an art gallery.</p><p>The one thing I’m not enjoying about General Hospital is some of the acting. Not mentioning any names, but there is lots of bad acting and over acting on that show.</p><p>I wish closed captioning would give the name of the character speaking. It’s weird to follow a storyline and not even know the names of the people involved. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png title=:sweat_smile: alt=:sweat_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I think General Hospital has more actors and actresses then Young and restless. Young and the Restless only focused on the same people instead of forcing on new one. They tried with Rey and Lola but sadly gone.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>General Hospital definitely has more actors.</p><p>If they had gone about introducing the Rosales family differently than they did, most if not all of them would still be around.</p><p>The way they were brought in one after the other reminded me of the scene in The Hobbit where a dwarf showed up at Bilbo’s door one at a time. First there was Arturo. Then Lola’s bra. Then Lola. And then Rey. Followed by Mia. Then Mama Rosales and then Papa Rosales.</p><p>Within a hot five minutes of being in town, each had befriended a wealthy person and either started dating them, slept with them, married them or moved in with them. The exception to the rule was Mia and they turned her into a total clown.</p><p>They were pushed into every single storyline at the expense of other characters. They were in practically every scene in every episode.</p><p>It was too much and too fast.</p><p>They were supposed to be a working class family. Well, they weren’t working class for very long. Soon everyone but Mia was involved with the wealthy. She tried but because they cast her as a clown nobody really wanted anything to do with her.</p><p>This soap desperately needs a working-class family along the lines of the Williams. They were a true working-class family.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I’ve tried watching GH but there’s SO many characters and stories I gave up. Maybe in a couple years when I’m “really” retired and my granddaughter (who I watch during the day) is in school.<br>When they had the classic episodes on 2 years ago it noticed that some of the Y & R sets had not changed in 20 - 25 years. Same furniture in Victor’s living room plus that Asian-looking chest in Nate’s/formerly Adam’s/formerly Neil’s (etc) penthouse. Must have come with the building.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p><a class=mention href=#>@Kristabell76</a> helped me find my feet with General Hospital.</p><p>If I had questions I would post in the following thread and she would answer them for me.</p><p>I am successfully navigating the storylines, for the most part anyway. There are a couple that I’m still confused about.</p><p>It’s now trying to figure out some of the character names because closed captioning doesn’t say who is speaking, I have to Google The General Hospital cast and look for a picture of the actor to see the name of their character.</p>I only watch one soap opera and that’s The Young and the Restless. I have been trying to give it up because the storylines have just become so pathetic. The reduction in sets is ridiculous. Everyone meets in the lobby of the Grand Phoenix, the coffeehouse or at Society to conduct their business. I’m sick of how Devon seems to have become the favourite character of the writers. He can do no wrong. I’m going to tune in to General Hospital for a few episodes and do some Google researching. I use…<p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>The difference is shocking, especially considering Y&R has been the top rated soap for years. Yet they are the worst for sets. Even Days does better, although many sets are cheap.</p><p>GH sets arent just big but really nice. As someone already mentioned the sets like the Abbott and Chancellor homes havent even had any new furniture.</p><p>Characters go from CL to Society in contrived plot points just to run into their enemies. Victor owns TOTT but he and Nikki are always at Society.</p><p>And the social event of the decade, the HWC merger party, is happening in the lobby of the GP.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I don’t watch General Hospital, so I can’t compare, but I have been extremely disappointed with the sameness of sets on Y&R for some time. Is it a COVID thing? Along the same lines, where are the extras? I think it’s been at least six months since someone not in the cast who was a customer at Crimson Lights or Society. Same with the park, hotel, etc.,</p><p>Maybe it’s just me, but I find it very depressing/distracting that there are no other people on this show except for the cast… and maybe the guy who diligently dusts the counters at Crimson Lights.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/r/9d8465/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> RickyK2022:<p>disappointed with the sameness of sets on Y&R for some time.

It started before that.</p><p>The Newman Ranch set was downsized before COVID to that one small room that they have now.</p><p>Victoria’s house used to have an entranceway, stairs, living room, and dining room. That was downsized to a couch, chair and a doorway leading into a dining area.</p><p>When Lily was living in her house, it used to be a huge big set with a gargantuan living room, kitchen and dining area. It was downsized to just basically a kitchen counter and table.</p><p>The Grand Phoenix hotel room has always been the only room in use there. A new painting gets hung over the couch and a few knick-knacks changed around for different characters.</p><p>More people moved into the Grand Phoenix because of COVID I think. All they have to do is clean one set and change a few knick-knacks here and there. Most of the time when somebody’s in that room they don’t touch anything so the cleaning crew really doesn’t have much to do to clean that one set in between it being used by a different character.</p><p>The GCAC seemed to go bye-bye when the Grand Phoenix opened. The GCAC roof-top set also vanished before COVID. That was my favourite set. I just loved the Decor and the colours.</p><p>I read in a comment on this board at some point within the last year, that the Young and Restless moved stages and their new stage area is much smaller than the previous one. Whether there’s truth to that or not I don’t know.</p><p>But I really don’t understand how General Hospital can have 39 big and beautiful active sets (actually 40 because I missed one), and Y&R, the <span class=hashtag-raw>#1</span> soap opera for decades, seems to have an ever-shrinking number of sets.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I just remembered another set from General Hospital.

Y&R didn’t move to a smaller stage, they are leasing fewer stage sets to produce Show.</p><p>A year before, 2017, Sony/CBS acquired Y&R from the Bell family. The Bell’s relinquished control of Y&R: advertising dollars are paid to Sony/CBS, Bell Dramatic Serial, Inc./Corday Productions before the Show production company, subsequently there were cost cutting measures instituted; fewer sets and cheaper decor (few characters have home sets, hotel room set repurposed for several character’s use), protracted contract negotiations, legacy characters let go (Paul Williams, Cane and the Twins, Esther, etc) or go on extended leave (Nina, Kevin, Ashley), killed off (Rey) or recast with unknown actors (Chance, Summer).</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Lila</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>June 13, 2022, 11:22pm <span itemprop=position>15</span></span><p>Interesting information, thanks for posting.

They wrote the family in such a way that it annoyed long time viewers. If they had been written slower and not so over the top with Mia, they could have been a YR staple. I loved having normal people portrayed on the show. Niki and …. What brother was it? It was hysterical. Arturo (sp?). That was his name. He was good with Abby. One of the few men she has had chemistry with! Mia had great potential. I liked the family and wish they had kept them on.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sea1.discourse-cdn.com/sheknowssoaps/message-boards/user_avatar/soaps.sheknows.com/chillami/48/3420_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Chillami:<p>If they had been written slower and not so over the top with Mia, they could have been a YR staple. I loved having normal people portrayed on the show.</p><p>Arturo’s introduction as Nikki’s boy toy-gigolo did nothing to ingratiate that character with the viewers. Not only that, but he was supposed to be Cuban and he sounded like he was from the Bronx. He was the middle child and he was the only one with an accent.</p><p>They went about introducing Mia all wrong. They shoved her in front and centre, with a pathetic backstory of being a stylist with some mysterious reason for Rey having left her.</p><p>The whole family was shoved at us so forcefully that it was like the writers were saying “We want this family and you’re going to like them no matter what! And we’re going to keep shoving them down your throats until you do!”</p><p>Mia was written as a loud mouthed, crazy, lying, manipulative, vengeful, dangerous, social-climbing, over-sexed psychopath. Over the top Day Dreams of hurting Abby with scissors and then ultimately going through with it, even though it was Lola that got hurt, was her claim to fame. She was nothing but a pot stirrer who lived to, and took great Glee in pressing people’s buttons and getting reactions from them. It was her full time hobby.</p><p>They could have done so much with her character. She was pretty enough. She had a fiery personality. And given the chance she could have probably been fun.</p><p>She was an attention Seeker and she would have been great in the role of a host of a gossip show.</p><p>Mariah has the on-air TV personality of a slug aka boring! Hillary was GC Buzz and Mariah was a sidekick for Hillary to insult.</p><p>They could have hired Mia as the stylist for GC buzz and given her a segment on doing makeovers and offering fashion advice to viewers, and maybe expand into home decor advice. They could have had some of Y&R’s “real” fans on to get a style makeover. Her introduction to the show could have been a new GC Buzz hire by Devon and didn’t know that she was Rey’s wife. It would have given her a reason to be in Genoa City other than trying to put her marriage back together.</p><p>That would have made Mia relevant and it would have kept her occupied with something productive to do other than being a pot stirrer.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvYZqlmrqNitKa6xKuYpWWYpMCxtdOao2arlanAcIOYaW9raW%2BlrqixnGs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-dies-in-saw-x.html><span>←</span><span>Who dies in Saw X?</span></a>
