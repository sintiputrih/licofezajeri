The man’s desperate act unfolded as he launched himself into the air before slipping into the 20-foot central void of the 9/11 reflecting pool.</p><p>Frightened witnesses looked on in horror as the man lay prostrate, peering over the edge into the abyss, and then slid forward, plummeting headfirst to the bottom. The impact left him with a gashed skull, and blood was visible in the water, captured by onlookers’ cameras.</p><p>Swift response from the Fire Department ensued, rescuing the injured man from the center drop, which contained about eighteen inches of water. He was found to be injured in his leg and was immediately transported to a nearby hospital, complaining of “back pain.”</p><p>Authorities received a distress call at 1:30 p.m. reporting a “jumper in the fountain.” The man was subsequently taken to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric assessment. Pending the evaluation, he may face charges of trespassing. This incident has raised concerns among police about the potential security issues in the area, although it remains unclear if anyone has ever previously attempted such a drastic act within the solemn grounds of the reflecting pools.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ktLbFjKKlZq%2Bfp7mledOrmJ2dXZiyr8DEq2SjrZ2lwG61za2mZqWVoryztcClZKudlqGypMDIp55mqJ%2BkuW61zWajqK%2BVp3qurc2hmK2skaN6tMHInKCdnV2WwbWxzKmraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./donald-brumfield.html><span>←</span><span>Donald Brumfield</span></a>
