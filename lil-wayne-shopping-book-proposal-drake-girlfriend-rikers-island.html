Wayne claims while he was serving time at Rikers Island for gun possession, Drake visited him and glibly confessed, saying, "Yeah, it's true. Don't f*** with her like that cause I did f*** her."</p><p>Wayne writes, "This is the type of s*** that a man never wants to find out when he's locked up. Or, maybe so, cause only God knows what I would have done if I wasn't locked up right now."</p><p>Wayne admits in the proposal he and his GF argued a lot, and that may be why Drake said, "Don't f*** with her like that." As for the timeline, Wayne says the woman told him she had sex with Drake the day before they met.</p><p>Wayne goes on, "I woke up feeling f***** up about the f***** up day that I had ... finding out that she f***** Drake was the absolute worst thing I could've ever found out."</p><p>And he says, "As a man, honestly, that s*** hurt ... and not because it was Drake, it could have been any man. It would've hurt the same."</p><p>Wayne then goes on and says he was so depressed he didn't come out of his cell for days.</p><p>We're told there's intense interest among publishers. We'll definitely read it.</p><ul class="social social--permalink"><li class="social__item social__item--3items"><a class="btn social__btn social__btn--facebook js-track-link" href=# onclick='return window.open("http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2015%2F03%2F20%2Flil-wayne-shopping-book-proposal-drake-girlfriend-rikers-island%2F%3Fadid%3Dshare-fb","_blank","status=0,width=575,height=450"),!1' data-node-ref=tmz:article:a7adc8a7-3199-50ed-9d1e-3363c286dfe9 data-context='{"section":"main","name":"facebook-footer","pos":1}'><span role=img class="icon icon-lg icon-facebook--white social__icon--facebook"></span> Share<span class=social__hide-sm> on Facebook</span></a></li><li class="social__item social__item--3items"><a class="btn social__btn social__btn--x js-track-link" href=# onclick='return window.open("https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2015%2F03%2F20%2Flil-wayne-shopping-book-proposal-drake-girlfriend-rikers-island%2F%3Fadid%3Dshare-tw&text=Lil%20Wayne%20Bitches%20Drake%20Screwed%20His%20GF&via=TMZ&related=HarveyLevinTMZ","_blank","status=0,width=575,height=450"),!1' data-node-ref=tmz:article:a7adc8a7-3199-50ed-9d1e-3363c286dfe9 data-context='{"section":"main","name":"twitter-footer","pos":2}'><span role=img class="icon icon-lg icon-x--white social__icon--x"></span> Share<span class=social__hide-sm> on X</span></a></li></ul><h3 class="card-section-title related-articles__card-section-title">See also</h3><a class="related-articles__card-link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=tmz:article:a7adc8a7-3199-50ed-9d1e-3363c286dfe9 data-context='{"section":"main","name":"related-article","pos":1}'><img width=300 height=169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imagez.tmz.com/image/82/16by9/2015/02/18/82d3d27e79265cd1a03da7923ba2d94d_xs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4 class=related-articles__card-title>Drake Honcho -- Birdman Screwed Me Too ...
