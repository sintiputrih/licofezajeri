The incident occurred around 11:30 p.m. when first responders were dispatched to the 300 block of Patton Street following reports of gunfire. Upon arrival, the Allegheny County police discovered the male juvenile with a gunshot wound to the head, and sadly, he was declared deceased at the scene.</p><p>Dillian Shearer was a student at East Allegheny High School, according to an email from the acting superintendent of the East Allegheny School District, Joe DiLucente, sent to the parents. In response to the tragedy, DiLucente assured the community that the North Versailles Police Department and district security would provide additional assistance to ensure the safety of students and staff. Extra counselors and community groups are being deployed to address the emotional needs of both students and staff during this challenging time.</p><p>Expressing concern and empathy, DiLucente invited parents and guardians to communicate any worries or support requirements for their children. Following the announcement of Dillian’s death, the school district faced an additional challenge as students reported a Snapchat post alleging a school shooting threat directed at the district. DiLucente, in a second letter, informed parents that the North Versailles Police Department is actively investigating the claim, emphasizing that there is currently no evidence supporting the credibility of the threat. As of the current publication, no arrests have been reported.</p><p>For anyone with information related to the incident or the alleged threat, authorities encourage reaching out to the County Police Tip Line at 1-833-ALL-TIPS. The community is left grappling with the aftermath of this heartbreaking event, as the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Dillian Shearer’s death continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ksaq4y6KYp2WjnbKivsSrZJ6Zo6l6orjLnp6hnZ6ueqm1xqFkrJuYpLytedKtrJ2dnql6pbXErGSonl2otbC706KloGWZo3q4tcumnKucmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./topher-griffin-bio-age-partner-height-alix-earle-friend.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Topher Griffin?
