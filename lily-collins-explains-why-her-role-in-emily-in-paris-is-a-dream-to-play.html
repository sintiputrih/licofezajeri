Emily was very much a dream role for me, and I feel like my answer to that would be: I really hope I get to play her in a Season 2. I hope that I get to play Emily again. It’s so fun,” she said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“It’s so tricky, though," she added, "to find the right [rom-com role], because you can be too stereotypical. It’s hard to find a good balance.”</span></p><p><span class=related-single style=font-weight:400>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lily Collins Spills The One Reason Why She Loved The Role Of 'Emily In Paris'</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Collins has also said repeatedly that she’s happy Emily can bring people joy during these hard times. </span><span style=font-weight:400>“There’s just been so much darkness for everyone in 2020 – it’s great to make people laugh and help them escape a little bit,” she told </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style=font-weight:400>Vogue</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>“It feels as though viewers are really losing themselves in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Emily</span></i><i><span style=font-weight:400>in Paris</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and just having a good time, so it’s come at the perfect moment, in a lot of ways. An American in Paris is by no means a revolutionary plot line – but right now it’s a foreign one that’s just not possible in real life.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Collins&nbsp;went on to say how much she admires Emily’s fashion. The main protagonist is best known for wearing bucket hats, 4-inch stilettos, and luxurious brands like Chanel, Dior, and Gucci. When asked which of Emily's outfits she'd like to steal for herself, she had a hard time deciding.</span></p><p>“So many things. Trying to think back on all the outfits is so tough.

I feel like the bucket hat was so iconic in the show, and it was quite a fun item of clothing for her.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Netflix has not yet announced if the series will be renewed for a Season 2.
