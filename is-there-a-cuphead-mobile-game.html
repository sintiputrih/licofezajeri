In 2017 it received the Best Art Direction, Best Debut Game, and Best Independent Game at the Game Awards, as well as a BAFTA for its music.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The title's DLC, Delicious Last Course, was recently released for the game, adding even more content than before and giving players more difficult and kooky opponents to face off against.

In fact, the developers haven't actually made any official announcement of a mobile version of Cuphead — but there are a few beta versions floating around online that you can try if you'd like, though none of them are technically the same as the full game.</p><p>Certain sites have uploaded the game with mobile controls so you can play it on your phone or tablet, though none of them are an official version of the game supported by developer MDHR. That being said, these bootleg versions have become moderately popular among those who want to take the game with them on the go. (Though, we should note that you can buy the game for the Nintendo Switch, so there are other ways to take the game with you while still directly supporting the developer.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to download 'Cuphead' on your phone.</h2><p>While it may not be an official version of the game, you can download the Cuphead mobile app online.
