Alum of 90 Day Fiancé In the first episode of their TLC spinoff, Darcey & Stacey, Darcey Silva presented her handsome boyfriend-turned-fiance, Georgi Rusev. Sadly, they experienced ups and downs right away, and despite being engaged, season 2 concluded with a terrible breakup. Georgi proposed twice to Darcey during season 3, but are they still together? Find out where they stand in their relationship right now by scrolling down below.</span></p><h2><span>When Did Georgi Rusev And Darcey Silva Get Engaged?</span></h2><p><span>Despite their problems, Georgi proposed to Darcey in June 2020 after they had been dating for four months, and she accepted, In Touch reported in October 2020. The first season finale included the couple’s engagement.</span></p><p><span>The issues they were having in their relationship were not, however, resolved by their engagement. His divorce from Octavia had been finalized when <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Georgi</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Darcey</a> first appeared in season 2. The pair was not in a hurry to get married, even though that meant Georgi could finally officially wed Darcey. <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/e-30760-1600-1200.jpg alt="are darcey and georgi still together" width=753 height=565 sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span>Darcey thought Georgi hadn’t been very truthful with her about his life and had been very secretive about his past. She reached out to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Octavia</a> on social media because she thought she wouldn’t be ready to proceed with wedding preparations until she knew more about him.</span></p><p><strong>See Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>’90 Day Fiance’: Big Ed and Liz Still Together? And Every Step Of Their Relationship</a></strong></p><p><span>Octavia revealed to Darcey that she previously saw a sugar mommy website on Georgi’s computer in a scene that aired in August 2021. Since they moved in together, Darcey admitted that she had been paying their rent, bills, food, and even supporting Georgi’s extravagant taste in designer clothing since she suspected that he might be taking advantage of her financial situation.</span></p><p><span>Georgi admitted to being interested in relationships with older women after being confronted, but he denied using a sugar mama website to meet wealthy women. Darcey left him behind and went back to Connecticut because she didn’t believe him. When she later learned that her buddy had supposedly overheard Georgi calling Darcey and her pals “American trash” and saying he would be “gone” once Darcey’s money runs out, her concerns about him abusing her for her money increased.</span></p><p><strong>See Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>90 Days Fiance: Kimberly Menzies Surprises Usman With Pregnancy News?</a></strong></p><h2><span>Darcey And Georgi: Are They Still Dating In 2023?</span></h2><p><span>They appeared to be over each other forever, but after Darcey’s father and her two daughters, Aniko and Aspen, were exposed to the COVID-19 virus, they reconciled.</span></p><p><span>They asked Stacey, her husband Florian Sukaj, and their friends to dinner to discuss Georgi’s alleged remarks after learning that her family had tested negative.</span></p><p><span>After they had a discussion about it, Georgi asserted that the remarks were untrue, and Darcey agreed to let it go. But as Darcey prepared to travel to Turkey with Stacey to have cosmetic surgery, the couple argued once more over her discussions with Octavia. <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETD_INTV_DarceyAndStacy_20220223_vidpic.webp alt="are darcey and georgi still together" width=741 height=417 sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span>After an extremely tense departure, Darcey utilized her vacation to reflect on how she felt about Georgi. She broke up with Georgi during her trip over FaceTime and instructed him to vacate their flat before she returned.</span></p><p><span>Their relationship appeared to be at its breaking point as he asked her out for the second time just before season 3 finished. In March 2022, Darcey revealed to Life & Style that she had separated from Georgi.</span></p><p><span>She referred to what transpired following his second proposal as “you know, there were many months of just false promises, and the tell-all thing was just the last straw…no bad blood.”</span></p><p><strong>See Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>90-Day Fiancé: Ben and Mahogany Are Still Together or Not?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJyRqbavs46aqZ5llJa%2FpLHYZpinnF2csrC%2BxqJkrKyZobluwM6gnK2glad8coOVbm9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-sosebee-woods-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Sosebee Woods Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
