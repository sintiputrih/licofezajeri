The responses did not hold back, with the choices ranging from those who nearly ruined the show or movie they were in to controversial fan favorites like Darcy Lewis or Korg. The original poster started things off with a solid contender for most annoying though, with Donna, Steven’s boss from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moon Knight.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>What’s the most annoying minor character in the MCU for you?</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Slowmobius_Time</a> in <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Remember way back in 2010 when no-one knew how much of an ego-maniac Elon Musk was and most people actually liked him?

Looking back on it now will make you cringe, he may not be too annoying in the film, but god, is he annoying in real life.</p><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Muted_Shoulder</a> from discussion <a href=#>What’s the most annoying minor character in the MCU for you?</a><br>in <a href=#>marvelstudios</a><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>There were plenty of characters from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor: Love and Thunder</a> who felt the wrath of fans. Korg; who had been a fan favorite since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ragnarok</a> is no longer regarded so highly. Maybe it’s because the over-reliance on jokes kind of ruined the tone of the movie. Or maybe it’s because the man behind the character is none other than the director himself, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taika Waititi,</a> and Marvel fans just aren’t ready yet to forgive the disgraced director. Well one Redditor has given us an in-depth essay explaining why they think the character sucks. They’ve obviously been ruminating on this for a while.</p><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/TheLoyalTR8R</a> from discussion <a href=#>What’s the most annoying minor character in the MCU for you?</a><br>in <a href=#>marvelstudios</a><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>The goats also got a fair share of hate; but no-one’s going to step up to defend those guys, seriously who even thought they would be funny?</p><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Slowmobius_Time</a> from discussion <a href=#>What’s the most annoying minor character in the MCU for you?</a><br>in <a href=#>marvelstudios</a><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Even Darcy who returned in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WandaVison</a>, after a long disappearance, found herself in the sights of angry fans.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=false>Sometimes we just love to hate certain characters, and that’s ok, it’s clear that characters like Donna are meant to be annoying for the audience. Other characters are simply just too much to handle but that doesn’t make them a bad character. It just means that some people can’t handle an outspoken and intelligent side character; mostly talking about Darcy here, if that isn’t obvious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopKKklGK2s77IrZitoZ%2Bjeqq%2FjK2fnmWfp7GmvoyonWasmJp6pa3YZpisZaSdsm65wq6qZpmeo7y6tc2gZJuZk6C0s7vUp5tmm5iWv6Kv056prGWXmsFursuaqq2dlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucasfilm-put-dinosaurs-star-wars-high-republic.html><span>←</span><span>Lucasfilm Want To Include Dinosaurs In Star Wars: The High Republic</span></a>
