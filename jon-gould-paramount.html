Some misspell his name as John Gould.</strong></p><p>A new <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> docuseries, <strong><a href=#>The Andy Warhol Diaries</a></strong>, was released on 9th March 2022, and this docuseries is based on a book named, The Andy Warhol Diaries by <a href=#><strong>Andy Warhol</strong></a>.</p><p>The book was officially released in 1989, and now, the Netflix production added actors and actresses in producing the book into a documentary series with the release of a total of six episodes.</p><p>The documentary series follows the life of<strong> Andy Warhol</strong> from the unique perspective of the artist’s published diaries.</p><p>While the story goes on, we get to meet a cast member, <strong>Jon Gould</strong>, the Paramount executive, and&nbsp; Gould plays a crucial role in the storyline and has more screen time on the show. Let’s get to know about Jon Gould and his connection with Andy Warhol.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <strong><a href=#>Jed Johnson</a></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><a href=#>Jay Johnson</a></strong>.</p><h2>Jon Gould Paramount Executive from The Andy Warhol Diaries on Netflix</h2><p>The Andy Warhol Diaries, a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix production</a>, is a documentary series based on the life of <strong>Andy Warhol</strong>.</p><p>He was an American artist, film director, and producer, and based on his life story, Netflix changed his life events to a documentary series and has divided his life story into six parts, meaning that the show <a href=# rel=noopener>will have six episodes.</a></p><p>Although Andy is the lead character in the series, Jon Gould shares almost the same screen time as that of Andy. He was the young executive at Paramount, and during his time at Paramount, he met the American artist, Andy Warhol.</p><p>Andy and Jon Gould firstly crossed their paths in November 1980 at an exhibition in New York. At that time, Jon was 27 while on the other hand, Andy was in his mid-50s. This is how Jon Gould is introduced in the series.</p><p>Gould is originally from an old family in New England and his family was extremely rich that, they lived on a&nbsp;900-acre estate in Amesbury, Massachusetts.</p><p>Jon and Andy didn’t meet because they wanted to but fate had written a beautiful story for both of them and thus, that eventually crossed their paths. In the third episode, the series elucidates the love relationship between Jon Gould and Andy.</p><p>Despite having a huge age gap, their love story was one of the best and carried immense love and trust towards each other. At that time, Gould was in the closet when he met Andy, and even though they were in a sort of relationship, Jon still decided to live inside the closet.</p><p>This perplexed Andy, and in his book, he had written, “It’s confusing because Jon tries to keep a ‘straight’ image. He tries to tell me he’s not gay.”</p><h2>How Did Jon Gould Die?</h2><p>The executive of Paramount, <strong>Jon Gould</strong>, and Andy were taking their relationship to a higher extent, however, a misfortune took away all their happiness in the blink of an eye. In 1984, Jon Gould was diagnosed with AIDS, and fearing the illness could transmit, Andy broke the relationship and left Jon during the lowest point of his life.</p><p>Then, Gould moved to Los Angeles and took his last breath at the age of 33. Although Jon was diagnosed with AIDS, he never revealed this to his close friends, and even at the time of his death, he kept silent and maybe his friends never knew how their friend, Jon Gould lost his life.</p><p>In the same episode of the documentary series, the audience gets to meet Jon’s twin brother, Jay, and speaking of his brother’s death, he told, “It bothered me that (his) dying of Aids was the story when there was this great (other) story about him.”</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Blurred Reality</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> of your favorite celebs.</strong></p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2024/03/sivaxya-rai.jpeg width=100 height=100 alt="shibakshya rai" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><a href=# class="vcard author" rel=author><span class=fn>Shibakshya Rai</span></a><p class="gb-headline gb-headline-30efdd49 gb-headline-text">Shibakshya Rai, our enthusiastic reporter, dedicated to bringing you the latest celebrity buzz and entertainment news.
