(He’s been bitten five times!) Now, the Aussie doctor faces a new type of challenge — sharing 25 things you didn’t know about him with Us Weekly! Tune in to catch the <a href=#>Vet Gone Wild</a> star on Animal Planet Sundays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>1. I had size 15 feet when I was 14. The only shoes I could find in my hometown were purple and green. I’m pretty sure it set me back a few years socially. My feet are still a size 15.</p><p>2. I’m not the only vet in my family. My dad and aunty are also vets.</p><p>3. My first pet wasn’t a dog or a cat. It was a cow called Bridget.</p><p>4. I’ve been bitten badly by animals five times. Four of them were . . . Chihuahuas.</p><p>5. I’m slightly color blind. Which probably explains some fashion choices over the years.</p><p>6. Aside from being a vet, I’m also a travel and wildlife photographer and have had my shots published by lots of magazines.</p><p>7. I’m allergic to only one animal. The rabbit. As a result, I always look like I’m highly emotional whenever I’m treating a rabbit.</p><p>8. I once got whiplash and tore my groin surfing a 12-foot wave in Chile.</p><p>9. The smallest animal I’ve ever treated was a pet snail in China. His owner (a 5-year-old boy) was worried he had small cracks in his shell. It turns out he had a calcium deficiency from only eating lettuce.</p><p>10. While filming Vet Gone Wild, I was bitten by a lion. But it’s not as bad as it sounds. She clenched down on my arm while I was putting a tube down her throat to keep her under sedation.</p><p>11. I once met Nelson Mandela but complete messed up our conversation.</p><p>12. I got my start on TV after telling stories to a girl in a bar while a TV executive eavesdropped on the conversation.</p><p>13. My dream animal to work on is a polar bear.</p><p>14. My best mate is a chef and he’s taught me some pretty useful tricks in the kitchen. My current obsession is olive oil chocolate mousse.</p><p>15. After my dog died on the eve of my Rugby grand final when I was 17, I wore a blue arm band [because] it was the color of his collar.</p><p>16. My worst habit is chewing my fingernails. I only do it when I’m anxious about how a patient might recover … and when I’ve been wearing gloves while treating that patient.</p><p>17. Bryan Adams is my go-to karaoke artist. I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize to Bryan.</p><p>18. I once received a death threat while delivering a litter of puppies. I was told that if the mother didn’t survive, the same would happen to me. That was a stressful night!</p><p>19. When I was 8, my family’s pet donkey “Pablo” was sent to a farm. My brothers soon told me what being sent to a farm really meant. I cried for days. Then when I was 18 I received a card from Pablo. It turned out he had been at a farm all along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Chris-Brown-The-Vet-2.jpg><p>20. I used to think LOL meant “Lots of Love.” As a result, I once sent a friend a text saying how ‘sorry I was to hear their dog had died. LOL.’</p><p>21. I was recently on a charter flight in Uganda when the pilot fell asleep. I coughed loudly for 10 minutes until he eventually woke up. There was so much coughing I think he thought I was the bigger danger to us.</p><p>22. Sharing the name Chris Brown with the rapper means I get a lot of feedback about his music on social media. Part of me hopes he gets animal questions just to even the score.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>23. Last year I was charged underwater by a 30-foot sperm whale. He didn’t mean to hurt me but just didn’t know what I was. I did get an incredible photo.</p><p>24. I once broke my arm attempting to do “the worm” on a dance floor.</p><p>25. I’ve had flying lessons and have even flown an F18 Fighter Jet. Busting through the sound barrier is something I’ll never forget.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2erF2cvK%2BxjLCgpZxdqMGivoycn6uho2Kvs7vWp2RrbV2ptaq6xqxksqelYrGwutNmoqenp2Kuo7vUrWSmnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spencer-rattler-ethnicity-and-race-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Spencer Rattler Ethnicity And Race- Parents And Net Worth</span></a>
