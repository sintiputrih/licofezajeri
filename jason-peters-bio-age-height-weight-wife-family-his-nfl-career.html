In 2004, he signed with his first pro team the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent.&nbsp;Years have passed since then and this player has grown his career much to the admiration of American football lovers.&nbsp;You will learn all about him in the following paragraphs.</p><h2><strong>Jason Peters Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>Jason Raynard Peters was born in Queen City,Texas on January 22, 1982 in a house owned by Christain and raised among three brothers: Jerry Peters, Tim Peters, Will Peters.&nbsp;His father is Bishop J. Peters and his mother is Teledeo Simington.</p><p>He was an alumnus at Queen City High School (TX) where he demonstrated his athletic ability in both soccer and basketball.&nbsp;However, since he excelled in football, Peters pursued the game in college and committed to play for the Arkansas Razorbacks football team at the University of Arkansas.</p><h2><strong>NFL career</strong></h2><p>Jason Peters went undrafted after the 2004 NFL draft, although he’s being predicted by sports pundits to be an early fourth-round decision.&nbsp;At 320 pounds, he recorded 61 more knockdown blocks than catches (21) from college.&nbsp;He eventually joined the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent in April 2004, but was dropped from the team’s roster and then reinstated on the practice roster.</p>A few months later (November 12, 2004), the bills he signed Peters in the active squad, where he earned a blocking bottleneck touch and feared becoming a wedge-breaker.&nbsp;Under the tutelage of offensive coach Jim McNally, he learned to play offensive tackle.Contending for the starting position, Peters was assigned the position by the Bills and received a 5-year, $15 million contract extension during the offseason.&nbsp;He started the 2007 season games as a right starter until Week 7, when the Bills reshuffled their offensive line and moved him to left starter.&nbsp;It was the same year that the soccer player played his best game and was selected in the AFC Pro Bowl team.&nbsp;This was the first time a Bills offensive lineman had won the Pro Bowl since 2003.<p>Attacking line coach McNally described Peter’s ability as limitless.&nbsp;However, the bodyguard, as he is also known, couldn’t make it to the Pro Bowl due to a groin injury he sustained in the game against the New York Giants.</p><p>Peters started the 2008 off-season as an unhappy player looking to improve his contract.&nbsp;It was reported that his fear was fueled by the fact that he was paid a reduced amount considering his position as Bills’ sole Pro Bowl blocker.&nbsp;He wanted to compete with other offensive linemen teams who earned far more in contracts and bonuses.&nbsp;He was reportedly requesting a contract extension of between $8 million and $11.5 million per season.</p><p>For this campaign, Peter intentionally missed the team’s training and mandatory mini-camps and was willing to sit out the entire season in exchange for a new and improved contract.&nbsp;Amid the holdout, head coach Dick Jauron said he would be fined and dropped from the lineup.&nbsp;Peter was fined over $560,000 for missing all of training camp after rejoining the Buffalo Bills on August 21, 2008.&nbsp;Through the end of the 2008 season, he recorded what has been called the worst left-start tackle in the NFL, 11½ sacks.&nbsp;He was also selected as the first tackle left in the Pro Bowl and a second-team All-Pro in the same season, which some felt was a dubious selection.</p><p>The following season (2009), Jason Peters was successfully traded to the Philadelphia Eagles on April 17, 2009 in exchange for their first-round pick (28th overall) and fourth round pick (121st overall) in the 2009 NFL draft. The Franchise Company signed the Eagles to a six-year, $60 million contract through 2014. His previous contract with the Bills, which was pending (in two years), was voided by the Eagles with team head coach Andy Reid explains He has always admired Peter’s game and considered him the best left winger in football.</p><p>Peters was selected for the 2010 and 2011 Pro Bowl as a starting offensive end and also the 2010 junior team All-Pro selection.&nbsp;He played consistently with the Eagles until February 26, 2014, when the team renewed his contract for an additional five years, valued at $51.3 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, he tore his Achilles tendon twice, on separate occasions, first during an off-season practice on March 28, 2012, and second after his personal equipment malfunctioned at home.</p><p>With a one-year contract extension with the Eagles, he continued playing with the team on June 14, 2017 and had his first Super Bowl ring when the Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII.&nbsp;The footballer suffered knee injuries at the ACL and MCL on Monday night against the Redskins.</p><p>The franchise, as its other nickname suggests, has played in 181 games from 171 starts since the beginning of his NFL career.&nbsp;He was named a 2018 top 10 player over the age of 35 with a cap hit of over $10 million.</p><h3><strong>His size and weight</strong></h3><p><strong>Height:</strong>&nbsp;6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;149 kg</p><p>The two-time All-Pro and nine-time Pro Bowler is “incredibly athletic for his size, having dominated his opponents well into his 30s,” according to ESPN boss Tim McManus.</p><h2><strong>Family and wife</strong></h2><p>Jason Peters is very private about his family life and is not known to have any wife or girlfriend. As far as we know, the 41-year-old is single and enthusiastic about his football career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiikai8r3nPnqueqqNir6q7jJqenmWYmraotNNmrp6hl53BbsPIn5xmnpGitq3FjKGgrGWem7lur8CrnJ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dorian-kingi.html><span>←</span><span>Dorian Kingi Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
