Well, creator Jang Ho-gi was surely happy as he was the one to put together 100 contestants — including Tarzan — from various ethnicities, ages, and genders as they competed against each other to prove their physical strength and ultimately for a chance to win the title of “most perfect physique” plus 300 million won (approx USD 243 thousand).</span></p><p><span>“Fight to the death. Survive to the end.” These were the words that appeared in the show’s trailer. The contestants competed to survive purely with their physical strength.</span></p><p><span>In the first ep, Tarzan and other contestants were placed in a massive space where plaster casts of their torsos sat on marble pedestals, arranged in concentric circles around a fountain. They then walked around, admiring each other’s plaster/actual bodies, objectifying and judging each other.</span></p><p><span>So, for the first challenge, the contestants then were asked to hang on to a suspended apparatus lifted in the air. Through this, the participants quickly realized that the show was not only a test of brute strength but also endurance and mental strength.</span></p><p><span>Later, based on how long they lasted, the players were then placed in order from 100 to 1, and in order, they got to choose who they’ll face in the first quest — a&nbsp; fight over a ball.</span></p><p><span>Overall, 50 matches took place in the same two arenas, just like </span><i><span>The Challenge</span></i><span>.
