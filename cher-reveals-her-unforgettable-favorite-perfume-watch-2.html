Or, as Corden puts it, ‘The Oscar of Smells — The Smellscars.”</p><p class=p1>When Cher launched her perfume in 2019, she didn’t just combine different notes all willy nilly. She carefully designed the scent with a mission in mind.</p><p class=p1>“I’ve always had this theory: If you smell like dessert men won’t forget you,” she says very matter-of-fact. “And it’s worked.” While Cher undoubtably had a point that smelling sweet makes your presence linger, Corden is quick to point out that her theory doesn’t work the same for men.</p><p class=p1>“It doesn’t work the other way around — I’ve realized. Because if there’s a food I smell like, it’s dessert. I smell like a profiterole, you know what I mean?”</p><p class=p1>Corden continues: “You know what I think the best smell for a man is? A man that smells like a fire — a log fire. Would you agree with that? … A man who can build a fire, a caveman.”</p><p></p><p class=p1>Cher claps back with a resounding no, pointing out that a “man who can build a fire, isn’t a man that smells like a fire.” In fact, she disagrees with Corden’s ideal scent so much, that she says, “You’re a crazy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>If you ask Us, it’s probably best to keep the perfume cocktailing to Cher, who has launched a handful of fragrances throughout her career.</p><p class=p1>Her most recent, Eau de Couture, is a flirty meets sensual blend, with notes of bergamot (Corden wasn’t totally off base!) and neroli.</p><p class=p1>It’s infused with a bit of citrus, with orange flower and jasmine, as well as a sweeter base of vanilla that speaks to the whole “dessert” motto.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i1pr6Mq5yvnZGhwG60xKtkrqaWpL%2BosdOtmJuklWKzosLOq6CtnV2lsrOy1KacZq%2BRqbCpeZFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./epson-epiqvision-mini-ef12-best-buy-deal-october-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Best projector deals: Replace your TV for as low as $59</span></a>
