Keep reading to hear about 8 celebrity recipes that are viral on TikTok.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kylie Jenner</span></h2><p>You may not think that Billionaires enjoy instant ramen, but apparently they do! <a href=#>Kylie Jenner </a>first released her ramen recipe in 2016 via Snapchat. However, it resurged on TikTok as it is a highly debated topic on the app of what to add to the noodles. Kylie adds butter, garlic powder, and an egg to hers, and people seem to love it this way. Sister Khloe Kardashian has also shared her ramen, a healthier option with fresh vegetables and chicken. However, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delish</a>, Kylie’s is better!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Criticized For Releasing Bikinis For Children</a></span></p><h2 id=gigi-hadid><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gigi Hadid</span></h2><p>If you haven’t heard about this recipe, you must not have been on your phone during summer 2020. Gigi Hadid’s spicy vodka pasta is said to be a close dupe to the New York restaurant Carbone’s spicy rigatoni that costs $32 a plate. <a href=#>Gigi</a> originally posted the recipe to her Instagram story last May, and it instantly became the new quarantine cooking trend. With tomato paste, heavy cream, red pepper flakes, and a splash of vodka, the sauce is the star of this dish. Many people have recreated it and everyone seems to love it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kourtney Kardashian</span></h2><p>Kourtney claims to have eaten her avocado pudding almost every morning for the past 5 years. Made with only 3 ingredients, (avocados, coconut milk and honey) there are mixed reviews on this healthy breakfast. In Addison Rae’s “Day in my Life With Kourtney Kardashian” video she posted last summer on Youtube, the besties ate the pudding after a work out and Addison loved it saying its the best thing she’d ever eaten. After that video, many people on TikTok decided to try it out and there were mixed reviews. Some liked it while others disagreed saying it tasted like baby food.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian Latest Instagram Snap Dubbed 'The First Real Family Photo'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lizzo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lizzo</span></h2><p>Lizzo is a frequent TikToker who often shares her meals with her fans. She participates in many trends like the delicious natures cereal (literally fruit and ice in a bowl with milk), and the not so delicious mustard on watermelon. Some of her own recipes that have gained a lot of popularity on the app include her vegan mac and cheese made with Banza chick pea pasta and brussel sprout nachos, in which she tops airfriend brussels with vegan meat and queso. If you are looking to create healthy meals at home, Lizzo is a must follow.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Debate Who Lizzo Would Put As The Queen Of Rap On Twitter</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>First ever posted on Taylor’s Tumblr account in 2014, her chai eggnog cookies became viral once again on TikTok last December with the release of her Evermore album. It starts as a simple sugar cookie recipe, but then adds a chai tea packet into the dry ingredients to give it that much loved flavor. Then in the icing, instead of using milk, she uses eggnog to add even more of a holiday taste! The swifties were quick to run and bake these, and they were obsessed.</p><h2 id=trisha-paytas><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Trisha Paytas</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Youtuber Trisha Paytas has always been vocal about her love for food. Her mukbang videos on both Youtube and TikTok have millions of views. However, in the past year, Trisha has been enjoying cooking for herself and sharing that with her fans. In February, she posted her “Fancy Butter Noodles” in which she adds garlic and salt and emulsifies it into a butter sauce. The recipe technically belongs to Youtuber Babish, however they are now known on TikTok as Trisha’s butter noodles.</p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Gordon Ramsay</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>Gordon Ramsay</a> is a very professional chef with hundreds of famous recipes, his vegan bacon seems to be all the rage on TikTok. While Ramsay was originally critical of plant-based cooking, in the past few years he has come around to it claiming “veganism is on the rise and we ought to adapt.” The “bacon” is made out of marinated tofu stuffed between two rice paper strips and soaked in a spiced butter mixture. Its then baked in the oven until crispy. Users who recreated it seem to think it is pretty good ranking it an 8.5/10 and calling it spectacular.</p><h2 id=chrissy-teigen><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chrissy Teigen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chrissy Teigen is the author of two cookbooks "Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat" and "Cravings: Hungry for More." She also has a website, Cravings by Chrissy Teigen in which she posts recipes for easy weeknight meals and an inside look at her life with John Legend and their two kids according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>. However, it is her banana bread that really has the internet talking. It became a trend on TikTok in early 2021, and the secret ingredient is a package of vanilla pudding mix along with coconut shavings. Fans have called it life-changing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Chrissy Teigen Explains Why She's (Mostly) Sober Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhknJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxlm665qrGMo5ynppWneqi1xqJkoZmUnrFuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZqOisqqkeqi70Z2mp2Wilrq0rdhmn5qcXaeypLXPnqpmn59iw6q%2BwKVkqKZdqbaswM6kZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./virgin-river-season-5-ending-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Virgin River season 5 ending explained</span></a>
