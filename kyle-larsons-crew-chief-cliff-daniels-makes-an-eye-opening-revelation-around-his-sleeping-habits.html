Following the season finale, Hendrick crew chief Cliff Daniels spoke about how he has been handling the post-season break. There were times when Daniels would barely get any sleep during the season.</p><p>The crew chief also spoke about what post-season had in store for him. Apparently, he was at Phoenix on the day after the race and ended up staying an extra night. He elected to abstain from being part of Kyle Larson’s victory tour in California. Nevertheless, he had a nice time just catching up with everyone. Now it will be important for him and the team to relax for a bit until they begin preparations for 2022.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What did Cliff Daniels say about the 2021 campaign?</h2><p>He <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>said</a>, “I have to some degree. Definitely not the night of the race or the night after the race, I should say. Since then, I’m definitely sleeping better at night. It’s been a fun week so far, we got back in town. Seeing all the smiling faces, just so happy to have the championship back in Hendrick Motorsports. I feel like, based on the season, no matter if it was the #5 or the #9, we wanted it to be in our house. It feels really refreshing and cool to be back here and see all the folks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2021-11-08T011057Z_2095155888_MT1USATODAY17117794_RTRMADP_3_NASCAR-CUP-SERIES-CHAMPIONSHIP.jpg><p>Now, he and the Hendrick Motorsports team and Kyle Larson will be looking ahead to the 2022 season. The coming year is a big one, as it witnesses the grandiose debuts of the Next Gen cars. There have already been multiple tests over the course of the past two years. The cars will make their race debuts at the LA Coliseum in February.</p><p>With nobody sure of who has an advantage over the other, there is a possibility of a shake-up in the pecking order. However, one can never rule out the Hendrick Motorsports team. Additionally, Kyle Larson and Cliff Daniels will want to retain their crown for a second consecutive season.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nascar-news-watch-kyle-larson-given-a-heroic-homecoming-parade-by-his-hometown-including-nba-team-kings?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2021-11-08T011057Z_2095155888_MT1USATODAY17117794_RTRMADP_3_NASCAR-CUP-SERIES-CHAMPIONSHIP-468x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">WATCH: Kyle Larson Given a Heroic Homecoming Parade by His Hometown Including NBA Team Kings</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8qyo55lnJa%2FtLvNrGScqpWseqS0yJ6dZpucnrOnecOapaKdnKh6rq3KnqpmmZ5isrqxjKinnqaZo7RuvsSvnKWZpJ68r3nAq6auppRitaq%2FjKyjnp2gnruoeceamaKso2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hugh-roberson-net-worth-282940.html><span>←</span><span>Hugh Roberson Net Worth</span></a>
