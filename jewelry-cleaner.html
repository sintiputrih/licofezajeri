To help you make a successful purchase, we put together a thorough buyer’s guide with all the information you need to find and use a jewelry cleanser.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Why You Should Buy a Jewelry Cleaner</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jewelry cleaners are popular and extensively used since they have several advantages. Here are some of the reasons why you should buy a jewelry cleaning solution:</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>It gives comparable results to using an expensive ultrasonic jewelry cleaning machine while being a more </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>affordable alternative</span></a></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>By helping you achieve the same outcomes at home, it helps you save the time, money, and inconvenience of having your jewelry professionally cleaned</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Using one to clean your jewelry only requires a little setup and some hand scrubbing</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>As a tiny bit of jewelry cleaning liquid is sufficient to restore the shine of your pieces, a small amount goes a long way</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Even if you find a piece that needs urgent cleaning, you can easily take care of it with the help of a cleaning solution and scrub brush</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>The hand scrubbing action of liquid jewelry cleaners is ideal for polishing delicate and dainty jewelry items as they have a fair chance of breaking in an ultrasonic jewelry cleaning machine&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h3><span style=font-weight:400>How To Choose a Jewelry Cleaning Solution</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Carefully weigh each option against your jewelry and gemstones to determine its applicability and efficacy. This should help you choose the finest and most useful jewelry cleaner available. Here are a few things to think about:</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Intended metals</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's critical to check that the cleaning agent is suitable for use with the metals you wish to clean before adding it to your cart. Pick your cleaner carefully to ensure it can clean your jewelry because some can cause tarnish and discoloration of certain metals. To avoid fretting about this, purchasing a cleaner that is versatile and compatible with all metals is always a good idea.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Ingredients</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s crucial to read over the ingredient list of the jewelry cleaners you’re considering. This helps you determine if the solution contains any strong abrasives or bleaching chemicals since these can affect the structural integrity and appearance of your treasured jewelry pieces.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Quantity</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s essential to determine how many jewelry pieces, gemstones, and precious metals need to be polished before getting a jewelry cleaner. A little cleaning liquid goes a long way, so it's vital to avoid buying excessive amounts because jewelry cleaners have a finite shelf life.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Eco-friendliness</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Numerous cleaning products contain harsh chemicals and environmentally hazardous substances, including phosphates, nitrates, and chlorine, that pollute water sources and seriously harm the ecosystem. They can not only infiltrate the food chain and cause significant harm but also significantly increase the carbon footprint. Selecting an ecologically friendly cleaner made with biodegradable materials is a wise decision.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Included items&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s often not enough to just submerge your gemstones and jewelry in a jewelry cleaner liquid. When using jewelry cleaning solutions, a cleaning brush is a necessary tool. These brushes are unique since they’re made to clean delicate and complicated jewelry pieces' difficult-to-reach parts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Purchasing a cleaning solution with an integrated tray, a cleaning brush, and a cloth is always a good idea, so you can start cleaning your jewelry immediately without having to look for the necessary tools.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Packaging</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>The packaging is the last thing you think about when choosing a cleaner to scrub clean your jewelry, but it should still be taken into account because it impacts how the jewelry cleaning solution is handled, dispensed, and stored.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>How To Use Your Jewelry Cleaner Solution</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Once you've obtained your cleaning solution, it’s time to </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>clean your jewelry</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. It’s relatively easy to use, but you must handle it carefully to prevent any unfavorable occurrences.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most jewelry cleaning products have an incorporated tray that can hold the jewelry while it’s being cleaned. But before doing it, it’s advised that you read the packaging's instructions. Next, submerge the jewelry and gemstones in the solution, then set your timer to the recommended exposure time specified by the instructions. If necessary, rub the pieces thoroughly with a brush. When the timer goes off, take the pieces out of the immersion solution because prolonged exposure can harm them. And there you have it, polished and clean gemstones and jewelry.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>How to Care For Your Jewelry</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since jewelry's exposure to the environment is inevitable, the resultant lack of sparkle from tarnishing and grime buildup is also an expected outcome. But, there are steps you can take to increase the lifespan of your jewelry and keep it in perfect shape for longer:</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>When wearing jewelry, it's crucial to avoid using chemical formulations like soaps, lotions, creams, and sanitizers because they might cause oxidation reactions that degrade the jewelry's luster</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Avoid wearing jewelry near water, including the ocean, a swimming pool, and tap water</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>It's crucial to use a microfiber cloth to clean all the pieces and surfaces after every use or every few days</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>It’s critical to separate all jewelry depending on metal type, arrange each category together, and store it in an anti-tarnish bag in a cool, dry environment</span></li></ul><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>How long does a jewelry cleaner last?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Even though liquid jewelry cleaners do not overtly expire, they have a shelf life of six to 18 months. It’s recommended to use one within that time frame since it can lose its cleaning power over time.</span></p>If I can't find a jewelry cleaning solution, can I clean my jewelry and gemstones with toothpaste?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Even though it’s a common household trick, we strongly advise against using toothpaste and a cleaning brush to scour clean your jewelry and gemstones. It’s wise to stop using toothpaste because it contains microscopic abrasive particles that could inflict scratches and damage to the jewelry.</span></p>Should I soak my pearl string in a jewelry cleaning solution if it seems to be losing its shine?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Pearls should generally never be cleaned with jewelry cleaning solutions because of their porous nature. It's crucial to only clean pearls with lukewarm water and a mild detergent to keep them in pristine condition.</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
