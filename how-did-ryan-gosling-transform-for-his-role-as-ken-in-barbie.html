Back in 2019, Margot Robbie was already speaking about <a href=#>what she hoped the film would accomplish</a>. “I think it’s a great opportunity to put some positivity out in the world and a chance to be aspirational for younger kids,” Robbie told Variety’s Marc Malkin.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>19 Things About The Human Barbie Doll That Make Us Squirm</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the filming, Robbie would discuss alongside Variety that there was pressure to perform, <a href=#>especially given what a nostalgia act Barbie really is for fans</a>. “Right, it comes with a lot of baggage! And a lot of nostalgic connections. But with that come a lot of exciting ways to attack it. People generally hear ‘Barbie’ and think, ‘I know what that movie is going to be,’ and then they hear that Greta Gerwig is writing and directing it, and they’re like, ‘Oh, well, maybe I don’t...’”</p><p>It is now Ryan Gosling's turn to add hype for the film. He did exactly that when his Ken promotional photo went viral. Once again, the actor was able to completely transform but it was no easy process, as one can imagine.</p><h2 id=co-star-simu-liu-admitted-ryan-gosling-was-in-the-gym-a-lot>Co-Star Simu Liu Admitted Ryan Gosling Was In The Gym A Lot</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked who did the gym better during Barbie, Simu Liu did not hesitate with his answer, <a href=#>claiming that Ryan Gosling was a lot more intense</a>. "Definitely Ryan -- 100 percent," Liu said. "He's definitely, like, a gym in the morning, gym after work kinda guy."</p><p>In all likelihood, Liu is referring to Ryan splitting up his gym day, likely focusing on fasted cardio in the morning, and working on sculpting his physique later on in the day.</p><p>Not only was Ryan dedicated in the gym with his workouts, but Liu would further reveal that the Ken actor outdid him when it came to the diet part as well. "As much as I I believe that I do have a work ethic, I also love food a lot," Liu added. "Just hearing little bits and pieces about, you know, just his strict diet regimen and just like how much emphasis he puts on taking care of himself and his body, I’m like, I respect it, I respect it. I’m gonna have some soda."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Tom Cruise's Diet Seems Like A Mission Impossible, Here's What The Actor Eats</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his ET interview, Liu decided to keep the rest of the info pertaining to the film a mystery, as the hype is already very real a year prior. What we do know at this point, is how hard Gosling worked to transform, and it was more than just a change of hair color...</p><h2 id=ryan-gosling-was-very-strict-with-diet-and-workouts>Ryan Gosling Was Very Strict With Diet And Workouts</h2><p>Gosling is very quiet when it comes to his dieting and training tactics. However, <a href=#>he did compare his muscles to pets alongside Men's Journal</a>. Although the comparison sounds odd, it does kind of make sense...</p><p>“After a while, they’re like pets because they [his muscles] don’t do anything useful. But you have to feed them and take care of them. Otherwise, they’ll go away.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of his training commitment, Gosling put a major emphasis on his upper body, especially his shoulders and upper chest, which really pop on-screen aesthetically. Workout wise, Ryan used a bodybuilding type of split, focusing on controlled movements and hypertrophy, which really just means pumping up his muscles properly and avoiding heavy movements.</p><p>The real difficulty to staying lean is in the kitchen. Ryan was consuming at least one gram per pound of protein, in order to really recover from his workouts. Carbs were likely moderate to keep his look and muscles full - though his fat probably took a hit, at a lower amount on the road to the film.</p><p>Ultimately, Ryan did a great job - and that's especially true given he's now in his 40s.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>What Fans Are Saying About Christian Bale's Insane Transformation For 'Thor: Love And Thunder'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledGymKdll6TArbXNoGStqpGjwKe70aZkn6eiYrWqv4yrpqWdXZbAbrfEp2Sipl2XrrOuyJ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-ancient-magic-hotspots-in-hogwarts-legacy.html><span>←</span><span>All Ancient Magic Hotspots in Hogwarts Legacy</span></a>
