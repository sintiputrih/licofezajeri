This time, we had to witness Curtis (LaVan Davis) being high for around 30 minutes and Ella (Cassi Davis) continually calling him inside the house. He kept repeating himself and the jokes, Ella kept repeating herself, and the rest of us viewers wanted to repeatedly bang our heads on the wall to mush.</p><p>At the end of the episode, Ella calls in Floyd, which was somewhat of a relief, but even that couldn't save the whole trash fire that this episode was. Also, just one question, who gets so high on weed? But logic doesn't need to be in question here, it was done for the sole purpose of being funny, which it wasn't. Also, plot twist, Ella decides to try the vape pen too, so for the next episode we're going to see 30 minutes of Ella being high, that's the guess here.</p><p>The vape pen had been found in Jazmine's (China Anne McClaine) pocket two episodes ago, and there had been much panic as the fam was sure she was on drugs. Janine (Demetria McKinney) was certain that her worst fears were coming true as she remembered her old days of dabbling in the same. The vape pen belonged to Jazmine's boyfriend Kaleb. CJ (Allen Payne) did not approve of him and in full 'Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air' style, threw him out of the house in one hand. Jazmine was hurt and upset, but after an emotional conversation, all was sorted. But, here's the thing. We still would like to know what happened to her boyfriend and the vape pen. 'House Of Payne' is known for getting into serious and powerful issues, despite all the comedy. It's a shame that this season of the show has just been beating around the bush and not living up to the buzz and hype of Season 8. While the new chapter had begun several plot threads, most of them were dropped halfway. So, we still don't know what happened on the Calvin (Lance Gross) and Miranda (Keshia Knight Pulliam) front, or even Malik's (Doc Shaw) stripper girlfriend Lisa, who is still living in the house.&nbsp;</p><p>'House Of Payne' airs on BET, Wednesdays at 8 pm. Tune in to pray that one joke doesn't drag on for the rest of the century.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooJ%2BqwKZ5zp9kqZmpo7Juv8SaqqimXW56przIrKadnV1mg26%2BxK%2Bgnq9dmMKzwMisZKWZXauur3nDmq2iq12dtqi0jJucrWWVobmiedWap55loJq7bsLInq6eqqNiwaK3xJqumrE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./plainfield-jim-mulyk-obituary-accident-murder.html><span>←</span><span>Plainfield IL Jim Mulyk Obituary And Death Cause: Accident Or Murder</span></a>
