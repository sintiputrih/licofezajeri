Fans of the original show will know that the task involves the contestants running from one side of the room to the other while stopping and standing still when an oversized doll turns around to watch them. In the reality show, the contestants have to play dead after pellets explode – but according to some of the former players, it wasn’t a fair fight.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Squid Game: The Challenge trailer looks seriously intense</figure><p id=e904_SXfI3W data-wc=42>Four players came forward, claiming that the Red Light, Green Light game was filmed for over nine hours in very cold conditions, and that they occasionally had to stay frozen for 30 minutes while medics helped those struggling with the freezing temperature.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Team HELLO!'s top Netflix recommendations</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/8d4a54157e4f-simone-ashley-bridgerton.jpg><ul><li>Stranger Things</li><li>Bodies</li><li>The Crown</li><li>Bridgerton&nbsp;</li><li>Queen Charlotte</li><li>Selling Sunset</li><li>Squid Game&nbsp;</li><li>Sex Education&nbsp;</li><li>Firefly Lane&nbsp;</li><li>Blue Eye Samurai</li><li>Virgin River</li><li>Sweet Magnolias&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=eqqELXLC2Hd data-wc=59>They also claimed that several contestants, who were social media influencers, wore real microphones, while most of the contestants wore fake ones – and that one person eliminated in the competition was placed back in the game.
