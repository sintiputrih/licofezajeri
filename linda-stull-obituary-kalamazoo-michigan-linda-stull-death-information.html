The obituary for “Linda Lernal Harvey Cullum Smith Stull” was a fiery departure from the norm, accusing the deceased and others of a myriad of abuses. The harsh tone and inflammatory content led to the publisher swiftly pulling the piece offline, leaving every attempt to access it met with an error page.</p><p>The author of this unconventional obituary, Gayle Harvey Heckman, the daughter of Linda Stull, expressed her motivations in a phone interview with the Sturgis Journal. “Well, honestly I wanted to write it for myself because I wanted to clear my name, she explained. For 24 years and before that, my mother has had to come up with a reason as to why her daughter isn’t in her life that doesn’t make her look like a monster. I had to reclaim my name.</p><p>In stark contrast to the fiery obituary that initially circulated, Linda Stull’s official obituary paints a more traditional picture. Born on October 1, 1951, in Mansfield, Ohio, Linda Stull passed away on December 12, 2023. The obituary highlights her marriage to the love of her life on January 8, 1986, and emphasizes her many years of service in the church, describing her as someone who loved and cared for everyone. The narrative takes a compassionate turn, acknowledging her battle with numerous illnesses and health issues in her final years, yet portraying her as a woman who always wore a smile and cherished her beloved pups.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKSZo7GiedKtrKWkXaSvqsDUmqmyZZuWuaK5wLOmqGWdnrCptcaapWakmaOxonnSraylpF2ZsqLAx2agp56fp7qiwMiopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julian-lennon-mother-net-worth-age-songs.html><span>←</span><span>Julian Lennon facts: John Lennon son's net worth, songs, parents and partner revealed</span></a>
