<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Politician: Yesli Vega Wikipedia Age And Husband - Former Police Officer And Politician Details</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>A look at “Politician: Yesli Vega Wikipedia Age And Husband” As a candidate for the Republican Party to represent Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in the U.S. House, Yesli Vega is a former police officer from Virginia.</strong></p><p>On November 8, 2022, she will be listed as a voter. Yesli is eager to fulfill Congress’ duty to act as a check and balance on the abominably incompetent Biden administration, according to her online campaign. She will put up a fierce struggle to defend the traditional American values of freedom and limited government as well as to reinstate the rule of law.</p><h2>Politician: Yesli Vega Wikipedia And Age</h2><p>She was born to immigrants from El Salvador in Houston, Texas. Her family has made the most of the freedom and opportunity that can only be found in America. Yesli spent most of her life in Virginia, where she now resides.</p><p>After a family tragedy caused by local gang members in a case of mistaken identification, Yesli decided to work in police enforcement. Unfortunately, a buddy lost his life in this catastrophe, and her brother suffered severe injuries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.celebseek.com/uploads/2022/8/d908b205-193c-441c-b8dd-6ff38f53b74e.webp><p>Yesli was moved to wish to give back and assist in defending other individuals in need by the professionalism and tenderness with which the neighborhood law enforcement authorities handled the circumstance.</p><p>The former police officer hasn’t discussed her age, but we can assume that she is in her early thirties after observing her pictures and lifestyle. Yesli is a part of her parent’s church and still works as an associate deputy for the Prince William County Sheriff’s Office.</p><h2>Meet Yesli Vega’s Husband And Children</h2><p>She is married to Rene, a former soldier in the U.S. army. She has been married to her spouse for fifteen years, during which time they have raised two lovely children. Rene and Rene met at their high school and continued their college love to become one of the decorated army couples of their locality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.celebseek.com/uploads/2022/8/66920289-3d1d-41b9-aadd-3a0e3c575765.webp><p>She started her career as a street officer with the City of Alexandria Police Department, where she encountered the life-or-death scenarios that our men and women in blue deal with every day they don the uniform in split seconds.</p><p>Yesli briefly quit the field of law enforcement when the United States Army ordered her family to accompany her husband on deployment in South Korea. After that, Yesli became even more appreciative of America’s devotion to freedom and human rights due to living so near communist North Korea and its constant threat.</p><h2>Yesli Vega Left Her Job Of A Police Officer To Become A Politician</h2><p>As her kids grew older, Yesli developed a more profound fascination with politics and the ideas put out by people in charge of defending our rights. She and her husband were concerned that the services offered by the local government did not correspond to the escalating real estate tax bills they were expected to pay as residents of Prince William County.</p><p>Because of this and a risky new political movement that aimed to criticize and blame police enforcement, Yesli was asked to serve in a different capacity through elected government. Accordingly, she bid for a vacant seat on the Prince William County Board of Supervisors in December 2018.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pbs.twimg.com/media/FaoZiF3UsAA3kMN.jpg decoding=async draggable=true alt=Image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Yesli received more than 80% of the vote in the Republican primary due to her dedication to supporting and defending conservative values. However, in a year with a blue wave, she later won the general election by 13 points in her district with a Democratic tilt. To serve Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, she is now running for election to the U.S. House. On November 8, 2022, she will be a candidate in the general election.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOqaaloaSesKqtzWawnqucnnq3scaaZLChm569prDImmSan5Virq%2BwjKGsrJqRo7Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lebron-james-golf-swing-bad-joke-nba.html><span>←</span><span>LeBron James shows off 'vile' golf swing that NBA fans joke is so bad it 'may affect his legacy'</span></a>
