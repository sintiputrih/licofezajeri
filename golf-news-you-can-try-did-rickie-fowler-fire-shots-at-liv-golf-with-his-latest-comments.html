The fans are allowed to choose their viewing platforms. Moreover, they have a Fan Village that includes various activities for golf enthusiasts. But, Fowler indirectly stated through his statement that all of this will never be a match to the Phoenix Open.</p><p><span>Rickie is happy with experiencing the sea of fans at the 16th hole just for a week. Moreover, he believes it has taken a lot of time and effort from Thunderbirds and Waste Management to make this event so successful.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Fowler was speculated to join LIV Golf</strong></h2><p><span>Last year Rickie was presented with a great offer to join LIV Golf. But he rejected the offer and expressed that he will stay with the PGA Tour. Moreover, the former world no. 4 believed things were going great for him there.</span></p><p><span>However, he also added that even though everything is fine, it can’t stay the same always. This left room for speculation that he might be considering joining the Saudi-backed golf faction. </span><span>Moreover, with the steep <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>decline in his performance</a> over the years, it seemed okay that he wasn’t making any hasty decisions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch this story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>‘I Would Have Taken a Bullet for This Guy’: Greg Norman’s Strong Betrayal With Chris Evert Forced His Best Friend to Denounce Their Relationship Once</a></strong></p><p><span>Even though he denied joining the LIV Golf rumors, fans didn’t completely believe him since many did the same only to join the league later. However, after his indirect dig at the Invitational Series, it became clear that he has no intention to play for the PGA Tour rivals.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8aoo59lnprEtHnYqKxmm5GjerW%2B2Gabopxdp7akt8ieZJ%2Bnp6Gys3nFoqmeZaOdvLW%2FjJqrZqSZq3qou8ufZLChpJ16qbXSZqOarJWowW6vzqaknqakqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yawt-yawt-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Yawt Yawt Net Worth 2024</span></a>
