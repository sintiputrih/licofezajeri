The jury in the case believed that Melanie McGuire shot her husband before she chopped up and disposed of his body. It was later found that Melanie purchased a gun in Pennsylvania. Further evidence of Melanie's guilt included relevant internet searches relating to gun laws and murder and a link between the McGuire home and the garbage bags in which Bill McGuire's body parts were discovered, among other examples (via&nbsp;<a href=#>NJ.com</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Melanie pleaded not guilty for what her legal team perceived to be a lack of physical evidence linking their client to the crime. They also claimed that William was addicted to gambling and was likely killed over gambling debt. Melanie believes her husband's real killer is still out there, as she told ABC News in 2020. During the court proceedings, Melanie did confess to an office affair with Dr. Bradley Miller and admitted that her marriage to Bill was unhappy. She also alleged her husband was abusive. Dr. Miller testified in the trial, but he is not implicated in the crime, though police believe that whoever killed Bill did likely have an accomplice.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
