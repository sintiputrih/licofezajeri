That should give them plenty of time to really secure a viewership tonight. With CM Punk scheduled to make his RAW return this week, it’s anyone’s guess how they will work him into things.</p><p>The New Day, Alpha Academy, The Creed Brothers, #DIY, Imperium&nbsp;and Indus Sher are all thirsty for an Undisputed WWE Tag Team Title opportunity. Bronson Reed will also take on Ivar. On top of that, CM Punk and Randy Orton will be there.</p><p><a href=#>It was previously reported</a> that Randy Orton is set to open the show this week, and CM Punk will close things out. Sean Sapp dropped the spoiler lineup for tonight’s RAW. This will be quite a show.</p><p>– Randy Orton promo</p><p>– &nbsp;Tag Team Turmoil Top Contender Match</p><p>– Cody Rhodes promo</p><p>– Bronson Reed vs. Ivar</p><p>– Nia Jax vs. Zoey Stark</p><p>– Seth Rollins promo</p><p>– Tag Titles: Chelsea Green & Piper Niven vs. Tegan Nox & Natalya&nbsp;</p><p>– Randy Orton vs. Dominik</p><p>– CM Punk promo</p><p>It was also noted that CM Punk’s promo is going to be one segment. Also, the Main event match is set for two segments.</p><p>We will have to see how everything pans out when the show goes live this week.
