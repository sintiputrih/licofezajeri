The cookbook author has also been adjusting to her new breasts, literally, after removing her implants this past June. She even simultaneously celebrated and mourned the surgery <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with a cake</a> that read “RIP 2006-2020.” After rocking larger breasts for about 14 years, the model realized that it was time for a change.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“They’ve been great to me for many years, but I’m just over it,” Chrissy had explained in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a> in June. She added, “I’d like to be able to zip a dress in my size, lay on my belly with pure comfort! No biggie! So don’t worry about me! All good. I’ll still have boobs, they’ll just be pure fat. Which is all a t** is in the first place. A dumb, miraculous bag of fat.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/chrissy-teigen-breast-reduction-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Despite the reduction in breast size, Chrissy admitted that her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bust was still “huge”</a> in an Instagram video in July. “I think I honestly will do it [breast reduction] again and have them make them smaller,” she admitted at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Chrissy got the implants in the first place for swimsuit modeling. “Yeah, I did my boobs when I was about 20 years old. It was more for a swimsuit thing. I thought, if I’m going to be posing, laid on my back, I want them to be perky!,” she revealed in an interview for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour UK</a>, in March. However, after welcoming her two children <strong>Luna</strong>, 4, and <strong>Miles</strong>, 2, at the time, Chrissy said, “But then you have babies and they fill up with milk and deflate and now I am screwed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5FqZpygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjerTDyKaqrqGkYsCmuMWinGaumZmysHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amelie-bea-smith.html><span>←</span><span>Amelie Bea Smith - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Facts, Height</span></a>
