Despite Jamie and his family being sworn never to tell William the truth about his parentage, the youngster still works it out – with the revelation taking place in the seventh novel An Echo in the Bone. Since we're currently on season seven, this could mean that the revelation happens in the next few episodes – we'll have to stay tuned to find out!</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: William has a main role in Outlander season 7</figure><p id=ewPw_fSZwYE data-wc=38>In the novels, William finally realises that Jamie is his biological father after meeting him.

Speaking about whether William was suspicious, Sam told Pop Sugar: "The stuff with Willie, for me and for Jamie, was really interesting stuff, to see where that relationship has gone to and developed." He added that there may have been "an awakening in Willie as to who his father might actually be".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3edc85862216-outlander-season-7-charles-vandervaart-william-ransom-1-768x1152-1651775237.jpg><p id=eCNqaBX6892 data-wc=44>He continued: "I was always looking forward to John Grey coming back, [and] I was definitely looking forward to those scenes. [David Berry and Oliver Finnegan] are great actors as well, so it was a nice side story for Jamie and Claire this season."</p><p id=eMZbNStgiNp data-wc=63>Chatting to Town and Country about joining the cast, Charles said: "It's such a massive show and such a lovely fan base. But I've been met with nothing but love so far. I'm not even on screen yet, and the fans have been so generous. We got a good casting crew, a great casting crew here, so we're all a good family now."</p><p id=eAiVNzBsM7X data-wc=12><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
