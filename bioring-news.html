<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>BioRing Smart Ring News: Specs, Price, Availability</h1></header><section class=post-content>It’s not exactly Green Lantern’s ring, but the <a href=#>BioRing</a> is a wellness tracker that is rugged enough to be waterproof and resistant to scratches while it measures various metrics concerning&nbsp;your overall health.<p>The <a href=#>Indiegogo-backed device</a>, from a startup with the same name, is designed to be gender-neutral and worn throughout the day, both in wake or sleep states. It is a basic ring form with no design or inscription that might make it overly masculine or feminine.</p><p>Inside, it has a number of sensors to track an extensive set of metrics that include calorie intake, fat intake, heart rate, calories burned, protein intake, sleep level and status, stress levels, water levels, activity intensity, as well as distance and steps.</p><p>Beyond the 3-axis accelerometer that measures activity and steps, there is a bio-impedance sensor that does a couple of things. It handles calorie intake, but it also sends electrical pulses with high and low frequencies to measure fluid changes in your cells. We’ve seen this tech in action on the much bulkier <a href=#>HealBe GoBe wearable</a>, which provided mixed results during our extensive review.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>The ring connects wirelessly to an iOS or <a href=# data-injected=1>Android</a> device to sync with the BioRing app to collect and arrange the data for a holistic view of your health. The onboard memory is able to save a week’s worth of data before syncing, so long as it still holds a charge. Sharing and social media features figure into the data as well.</p><p>The smart ring even vibrates for incoming notifications from the BioRing app, as well as other notifications from your phone. It’s unclear which notifications you can receive with the ring, but the company says you can customize the vibration alerts to differentiate between notifications, much like you can with the more fashion-forward <a href=#>smart bracelet and smart rings by Ringly</a>.</p><p>The BioRing comes in black and white, or a limited sterling silver model, with multiple size options. It is available starting at an early-bird price of $200, while the regular retail price is going to be $300. If you’re interested, you can <a href=#>back the project here</a>, but be aware that this campaign — like every other crowdfunding campaign — may experience delays.</p><p>Having already tripled its funding goal, the BioRing looks to be well on its way to meeting its shipping promise to early backers slated for November 2016. The company also claims to have a working prototype ready and a setup for manufacturing the device. The funds from its campaign will be used to perfect the prototype and move on to mass production, BioRing says.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfrLKivsCbo56rX5e2sL7Ip55mppWswHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-ashley-judds-hollywood-career.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Ashley Judd's Hollywood Career?</span></a>
