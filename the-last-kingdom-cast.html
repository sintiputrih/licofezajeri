The Last Kingdom is a British historical fiction drama that Stephen Butchard created for television based on Bernard Cromwell’s book series The Saxon Stories. The epic series, which is set in the early Middle Ages and covers several decades, details one of the most turbulent times in British history—the Viking invasion of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.</p><p>The Last Kingdom has received plaudits ever since its 2015 release for its breathtaking photography, fully detailed characters, and dramatic fight scenes. Sadly, the fifth and last season of the series debuted on Netflix in 2022, although it is planned that the show will continue with the standalone sequel movie Seven Kings Must Die, which is now filming on location in Hungary.</p><p>Although a release date for Seven Kings Must Die has not yet been set, it has been known that the cast will include both new faces and some returning cast members. Here is a brief guide for people who want to become acquainted with the cast and characters from The Last Kingdom before the release of the sequel.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Arnas-Fedaravi-ius-Millie-Brady-and-Mark-Rowley-in-The-Last-Kingdom-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Alexander Dreymon – Uhtred</h3><p>The Last Kingdom’s lead character, Uhtred, is played by German-born American Horror Story: Coven actor Alexander Dreymon. Uhtred is the orphaned son of a Saxon lord who was abducted and raised by Danish Vikings. He is constantly torn between his ancestry and the pagan warriors he has come to know as family. In Seven Kings Must Die, Dreymon will play Uhtred once more.</p><h3>Arnas Fedaravičius – Sihtric</h3><p>Sihtric was first portrayed by Lithuanian actor Arnas Fedaraviius in The Last Kingdom’s second season. Sihtric is the adopted child of a Viking warrior who later turns out to be one of Uhtred’s most dependable comrades.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uf111944674734b55ed2f091b4973f008><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>‘The Last Kingdom’ Season 5 Ending Explained | What Will Happen In Next Season?</span></a><h3>Cavan Clerkin – Father Pyrlig</h3><p>In the role of Father Pyrlig, a Welsh warrior-turned-priest who supports Uhtred’s cause, Cavan Clerkin completes the cast of The Last Kingdom. For his parts in the British television series Pulling and The Capture, Clerkin is best known outside of The Last Kingdom.</p><h3>Eliza Butterworth – Aelswith</h3><p>Eliza Butterworth, a RADA-trained British actress (who appeared on the depressingly-titled final episode of ITV’s DCI Banks), has been a series regular since The Last Kingdom season 2. Butterworth portrays Aelswith, the obstinate wife of King Alfred of Wessex who harbours a resentment toward Uhtred.</p><h3>Emily Cox – Brida</h3><p>Brida, a fellow Saxon who was abducted with Uhtred as a toddler, grew to love him before turning into his adversary. Emily Cox, an Austrian actress well known for her part in the German comedy series Jerks, plays the character.</p><h3>James Northcote – Aldhelm</h3><p>Aldhelm is Lord Aethelred’s right-hand man and a senior officer in his army. He is the husband of Aethelflaed. James Northcote, a British actor who has been in the horror films Patient Zero and The Imitation Game, plays him.</p><h3>Mark Rowley – Finan</h3><p>A fearsome Irish warrior named Finan swears allegiance to Uhtred and assists him in battle. He is portrayed by Scottish actor Mark Rowley, a cast member of The Spanish Princess, who joined The Last Kingdom in the second season.</p><h3>Millie Brady – Aethelflaed</h3><p>Millie Brady, who starred in Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, plays Aethelflaed in the programme. She is the obstinate and impulsive daughter of King Alfred of Wessex and Queen Aelswith, who rises to prominence in The Last Kingdom.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ubbf5d20591c9313b7c8f903ed33648bf><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Explained: How The Last Kingdom Season 5 Ending Leaves Scope For A Sequel Movie!</span></a><h3>Timothy Innes – King Edward</h3><p>Timothy Innes, who starred in the movie Harlots, joined The Last Kingdom’s cast in the third season.
