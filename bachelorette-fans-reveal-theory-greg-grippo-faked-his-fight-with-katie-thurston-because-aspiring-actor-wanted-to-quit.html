It’s his audition for the rest of his career. I knew there was something off with this dude from Day 1. #TheBachelorette #greggrippo.”</p><p>Another wrote: “Greg Grippo joins the acting ranks of legends after tonight’s performance #bachelorette.”</p><p>A third wrote: “His acting couch was paid top notch premium price and has worked with talents such as Michael B. Jordan and Tom Holland. Bravo Greg Grippo! Exit stage left.”</p><p>Some shared: “I knew #greggrippo was acting after his terrible monologue. I’m a casting director and have seen hundreds of actors indicate their way through a monologue. He was faking. And is also a bitch. #BachelorNation #TheBachelorette #TheBacheloretteABC.”</p><p>Another tweeted: “Greg Grippo showing off his acting skills tonight #TheBachelorette.”</p><p>In June a source told The Sun Greg is “lying” about his career and is really an “ACTOR” who is “seeking fame.’</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reality contestant</a>&nbsp;has been accused of attempting to “pull a fast one” on the audience by portraying his profession in marketing and scrubbing much of his on-camera past off his social media accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the 27-year-old’s ABC bio and LinkedIn profile, he is a marketing sales representative for a New York-based company, Mondo.&nbsp;</p><p>His only education is listed as obtaining a Bachelor’s in marketing from Saint Michael’s College in Vermont.&nbsp;</p><p>However, an insider revealed to The Sun that “Greg is an actor” – which has “always been his passion.”&nbsp;</p><p>“He is absolutely lying about his career and intentions on the show. He’s always wanted to pursue an on-camera career,” they said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun was able to confirm that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg</a>&nbsp;attended the prestigious William Esper Studio, a New York City acting school, from 2017-2019, which has not been mentioned at all on the show.</p><p>The informant continued: “He had a big ego, but most kids at that school did.&nbsp;He did speak a lot about fame though and it seemed like he needed a lot of recognition to feel good about himself.&nbsp; For some reason, he’s trying to come off like he’s in marketing which is just not true. Or if it is, is just an extremely recent development and not at all how he’s portraying it.”</p><p>The source continued: “Greg thought he could pull a fast one on the audience by just not acknowledging he’s a trained actor and pretending to be some marketing guy.&nbsp;</p><p>“He deleted so much off his social media account and LinkedIn of any signs of acting and has told friends not to mention it if anyone asks about it. And he’s untagged himself from all of his classmates’ photos.&nbsp;His profiles don’t even mention going to William Esper, which is a really high honor in the acting world.”</p><p>Earlier today, the&nbsp;Bachelornation.Scoop&nbsp;Instagram account shared a&nbsp;<a href=#>tweet&nbsp;</a>from Connor read: “There was no gaslighting in the episode, there was a fight between two people that you maybe saw 20% of.</p><p>The account captioned the post: “Connor defended Greg on Twitter. He says there was no gaslighting when Katie herself (who was there) shared a post about gaslighting #thebachelorette.”</p><p>Yesterday,&nbsp;<a href=#>Katie&nbsp;</a>shaded Greg posting about the effects of&nbsp;<a href=#>gaslighting&nbsp;</a>after fans accused him of “narcissistic” and “manipulative” behavior.</p><p><a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>&nbsp;star broke down in a “heartbreaking” moment on Monday’s episode after Greg stormed off set claiming he was “done” with the show.</p><p>Katie, 30, took to&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;to re-share a post from the account&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@soyouwanttotalkabout</a>&nbsp;detailing “gaslighting” and the way to identify someone who is “emotionally abusive.”</p><p>The post read: “So you want to talk about gaslighting,” as it explained the history behind the “psychological manipulation” tactic.</p><p>“Gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse or psychological manipulation involving distorting the truth in order to confuse or instill doubt in another person to the point they question their own sanity or reality,” the account claimed.</p><p>From there, the post spoke about the origin of the tactic, and how it includes “lying, discrediting, deflecting blame, minimizing, shifting blame, denying wrongdoing, using compassion as a weapon, and rewriting history.”</p><p>Finally, the Instagram account closed with the statement: “according to mental health professionals, gaslighters are most commonly narcissistic.”</p><p>Monday’s emotional episode saw Katie fall out&nbsp;<a href=#>with Greg.</a></p><p>The contestant became enraged and claimed he reached his “breaking point” after Katie wouldn’t say she loved him.</p><p>After returning home with Greg to meet his mother Sandra, she was so sure she would be giving him a rose that she said: “I hate to use the word frontrunner, but he is.&nbsp;</p><p>“And with Greg, I don’t know if I can even say this but he absolutely will be here next week. Greg and I are a perfect match.”</p><p>Later, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC actor</a>&nbsp;broke down in tears as he told his mom: “I am absolutely in love with Katie. I really can see myself getting down on one knee at the end of this and proposing.”&nbsp;</p><p>After returning from hometown visits, Greg told Katie: “I had no idea I was going to fall in love with you but I did.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have never been this vulnerable in my life with anyone. I won’t get down on one knee twice, it’s a one-deal thing for me and I know I won’t have any regrets at the end of this.”</p><p>However, the bank marketing manager replied shortly: “I just love looking at you,” causing Greg to become uneasy.</p><p>The pair then&nbsp;<a href=#>erupted into an argument</a>&nbsp;as the New Yorker claimed he was “disappointed” and “unhappy” after “emptying his heart out” and not receiving an equal response.</p><p>The next morning,&nbsp;<a href=#>Greg</a>&nbsp;visited Katie’s hotel room and confessed it “scared the hell out of him” that she didn’t say she loved him.</p><p>The TV personality admitted she was just “confused” but that enraged the actor further, as he went on a rant about how he was “done” with the show and their relationship.</p><p>After he stormed off, Katie began screaming: “I’m done. I am done I am done I am done. I’m going home,” before calling it the “biggest heartbreak” of her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000667041130.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670632552-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670462360.jpg><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bachelorette Katie Thurston’s frontrunner Greg Grippo fight leads to his ‘breaking point’</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9SnmpqslZy8s7XZnptompGYtaa4zqucrayVYrOiutJmqZ6ulZa5bsDHnqarsV2cv6azjKCpoqigpHqnrcqem2agmah6p7XGoatmr5mptW63wK2gnmWkncKzv9OopWaalZiutr%2FEZpisqJmntq%2BzjJqaraeiYsSiutOem2asn2K%2BtrXTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brandon-collofello-obituary-las-vegas-nv-orthopedic-hand-surgeon-has-died.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tom Emmer, the Republican nominee for speaker of the House from Minnesota who pulled out hour</span></a>
