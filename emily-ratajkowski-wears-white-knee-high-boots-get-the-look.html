Emily Ratajkowski’s boots are made for walking — and slaying.
The model and former actress was spotted leaving her podcast studio, where she records “High Low with EmRata,” in New York City on Wednesday, August 30. She wore a mini pinstripe dress and sunglasses, carrying a Dior bag over her shoulder. The wind glamorously caught her sleek, brunette locks."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She wore a mini pinstripe dress and sunglasses, carrying a Dior bag over her shoulder. The wind glamorously caught her sleek, brunette locks.</p><p>It was her shoe choice, however, that initially caught our eye. She wore white knee-high leather boots with a little bit of slouch — and a surprise kitten heel in back. Black boots have always been a staple, but after seeing this look, we know it’s time for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a change</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/emily-ratajkowski-white-boots-2.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Easyfox Knee-High High-Heel Boots</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$70</a> at Amazon!

Each boot has a zipper down the side for an easy on and off, as well as a sturdy rubber sole, a breathable lining and a comfy padded insole. The slouch factor is just right too!</p><p>This boot (also available in black!) is a must for mini dresses, as proven by Ratajkowski, but we’d also love to see with a plaid skirt and band tee or even short shorts and a lace-up top.
