He went on to act in several minor roles before he shot to fame after he won a Tony Award for the 1960 musical "Bye-Bye Birdie."</p><p class=dh>He went on to appear in other roles in several other films such as the 1964 "Mary Poppins," "What A Way To Go," and also the 1967 "Divorce American Style." Throughout his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/dick-van-dyke-mary-tyler-moore-124409/>on-screen career</a>, Dyke has bagged several enviable accolades, including several Emmys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b501b85affb18edd7974030db6706fa2.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore on the set of "The Dick Van Dyke Show" and later during the TV Land Awards | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MARY TYLER MOORE</strong></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001546/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">Moore</a> was born in Brooklyn in 1936, and soon after, her family moved to California. Her mother was an alcoholic, and this made Moore's childhood a nightmare.</p><p class=dh>She started as a dancer, performing for commercials, but as she progressed, she began taking on roles as a guest star in the TV series "Richard Diamond, Private Detective."</p><p class=dh>Dyke and Moore first met after Dyke was cast for the "The Dick Van Dyke Show," and the brains behind what was considered one of the most exceptional shows on TV, Carl Reiner, was looking to see if Moore would qualify to play Laura.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/56ea95a20d5b9fe50100a47e2dba1c82.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Dick Van Dyke, US actor, and Mary Tyler Moore, US actress, in a wedding dress, with a piece of icing from a wedding cake on her finger, in a publicity portrait issued for the US television special, 'Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman', USA, 1969. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>At the time, Moore was in her early twenties. Dyke remembers wondering if the young girl was fit for comedy, thinking to himself that she was too young, but the moment Reiner saw her, he knew she would be a perfect fit.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE DREAM TEAM</strong></p><p class=dh>After joining the show, Moore quickly picked up the pace, and a few episodes in, she was already making her co-stars laugh with her genius comic timing. Dyke <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/dick-van-dykes-tribute-mary-tyler-moore-she-was-just-best-968672/>recalls</a> their first few moments on the show:</p><p class=dh>"She just grabbed onto the character and literally turned us into an improv group, it was so well-oiled.

He was generous and would <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thelist.com/376747/what-dick-van-dykes-relationship-with-mary-tyler-moore-was-really-like/>celebrate her wins</a> with her.</p><p class=dh>The show ran for six consecutive years, and in 1966, they all won the Emmys in the comedy category, which was added only that year. But the win accompanied sad news.

It resonated with many women, making it an instant hit, and Moore did it justice.</p><p class=dh>In 1970, Moore ended the show, but her subsequent roles often fell short of the Mary Richards character. After trying to star in several roles without success, she finally started landing dramatic roles in films such as "Ordinary People" and "Finegan Begin Again," among others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f13bd9cf8f7e03075e881924b7892921.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Mary Tyler Moore speak onstage during The 18th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards broadcast on TNT/TBS at The Shrine Auditorium on January 29, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001813/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">Dyke married</a> Marjorie Torrell Willett in 1948, and together, they had four children. They wed on the radio show "Bride and Groom" as it provided home appliances and wedding rings.
