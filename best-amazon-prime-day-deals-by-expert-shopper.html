Some sneaky merchants put their prices up in the weeks leading up to the deals bonanza to make shoppers think they’re getting a good deal on the day. The deals we list are definitely not using this tactic, but if you want to do your own research, you can use a shopping assistant browser extension like <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>CamelCamelCamel</a>&nbsp; or <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Keepa</a> which can show you how the price of a product has changed over time and alert you if it’s cheaper on another retailer.</p><p id=e2jHpsA8SVE data-wc=2><strong>In addition:</strong></p><ul><li data-gid=eTiv9j31N7xY><strong data-gid=eAvBTN4vTgPU>Mark your calendar:&nbsp;</strong>The confirmed Prime Day dates are July 16 and 17.</li><li data-gid=e9pWgs_WGJo_><strong data-gid=e-ET-Zmnm70b>Make a list of the deals you want:</strong> Be targeted about the products you’re looking for.
