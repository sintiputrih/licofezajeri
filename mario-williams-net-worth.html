Previously, he played for the Houston Texans and Buffalo Bills.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Mario Williams is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Mario`s net worth is as high as $30 million, earned largely through his successful career as a professional football player.</p><h3>Mario Williams Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>From his teen years, Mario started showing off his athleticism, and while attending Richlands High School, he excelled in football and track. He received several honors for his great plays, including his jersey number 82 being retired by the school, among many other awards.</p><p>After high school, he enrolled at North Carolina State University, where he continued to play football, for three years, before he declared for the 2006 NFL draft. He was selected as the first overall pick by the Houston Texans, and immediately signed a contract worth $54 million over six years, which certainly established his net worth.</p><p>In his first season in the NFL, Mario`s posted mediocre numbers at best, as he had only 47 tackles, and 4.5 sacks. The following year, Mario stepped up in his game, and had one of his best seasons in the NFL, recording 59 tackles and 14 sacks, which earned him several awards and honors, including First-team All-Pro selection, and NFL Alumni Defensive Lineman of the Year. Mario continued with great performances in the next few years, however, injuries began to plague him, and his numbers dropped down; in 2011 he played in only five games, recording just 11 tackles and 5 sacks. That year his contract expired, and he became a free agent. The Texans didn`t resign him and Mario became a Buffalo Bill, signing a contract worth up to $100 million, with half of that guaranteed, over six years. This certainly contributed a lot to Mario`s already impressive net worth.</p><p>As a part of the Bills, Mario`s numbers increased as in his first season had 46 tackles with 10.5 sacks, and the next one was as good, having 38 tackles and 13 sacks, and his numbers were even higher in 2014, with 42 tackles and 14.5 sacks. These improvements won him new honors and awards, including a Pro-Bowl appearances, and First-team All-Pro selection. Unfortunately for him, in the 2015 season the Bills hired a new head coach, Rex Ryan, who changed the formation, and Mario fell out from his original position, which limited him to only 19 tackles and five sacks. After the season`s end, Mario was released by the Buffalo Bills.</p><p>Just a week later, Mario found a new club, signing a contract with the Miami Dolphins worth $17 million, over two years, increasing further his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Mario was engaged to Erin Marzouki, but the couple broke off in 2014. Mario`s current residence is a 9,389-square-foot home in Orchard Park, New York, which he bought for $2 million.</p><p>Mario enjoys boating in his free time, and has designed a boat with the help of the MasterCraft Boat Company back in 2010.</p><p>He is also a philanthropist; he has made several donations to the Houston Police department, and has started breakfast cereal production called MariO`s”, the revenues from which go to a Buffalo charity supporting children with cancer and their families.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.597966728281><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Mario Williams</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 31, 1985</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Richlands, North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 5 in (1.98 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>292 lbs (132.45 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>American football defensive end</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>North Carolina State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Don Thompson, Mary Thompson</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Michelon Javate Williams, Michale Joseph Williams, Michael Jermaine Williams</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Mario Jerrel Williams</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/bbwolf94</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/bbwolf94/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2254826/</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3.2418879056047><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=6.4760479041916><td>1</td><td>Selected by the Houston Texans with the first pick in the 2006 draft.
