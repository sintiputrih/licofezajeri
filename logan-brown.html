When Logan was born, he was assigned female at birth, but as he grew up, he didn’t feel comfortable with that identification.</p><p>He didn’t like dressing and behaving in ways typically associated with girls. Instead, he preferred a more tomboyish appearance. At 13, Logan had an important realization about his identity.
