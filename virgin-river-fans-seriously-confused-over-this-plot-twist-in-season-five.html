Warning! <strong>Spoilers ahead for the first three episodes of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Virgin River…</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The official trailer for Virgin River season five</figure><p id=eNl1etF0mb4 data-wc=55>In the first two episodes of Virgin River, viewers were reunited with Paige (Lexa Doig) after her dramatic return at the end of season four. Preacher (Colin Lawrence) and his former flame soon realised that their feelings for each other were still there – leading him to cut off his romance with Julia (Lucia Walters).</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss...</h4><p id=eg0vlbqG-eE data-wc=50>But things took a turn when Paige decided that she and her son, Christopher, couldn't stay in Virgin River due to the trauma they've faced in the past. In episode two, the couple had an emotional goodbye as Paige thanked him for being a pillar of support for her family.</p><p id=e_nxftoPwMl data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Virgin River fans share concern for beloved character's fate in new season</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e5MQXb0Q5kt data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Virgin River star Alexandra Breckenridge 'trying really hard to stay busy' amid season six disappointment</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9fa0d5d64aad-virginriver-paige-played-by-lexa-doig.jpg><p id=e_GHhlYBawT data-wc=49>Fans, however, were confused by the plot twist and took to social media to give their thoughts. One person wrote on Twitter, now known as X: <strong>"What was the purpose of bringing Paige back, only for her to leave? Why can't Preacher be happy without baggage or complications? Why?"</strong></p><p id=eVoYQ_xl8Hg data-wc=42>Another agreed: "Paige did all that running and had Preacher taking care of her son, putting his life in danger to save her and even left the new woman he was dating and now she can't stay in #VirginRiver??? Oh, girl please."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6675d6c8b63a-preacher-and-paige-virgin-river-season-5.jpg><p id=ekRKF_5BV9c data-wc=69>A third wrote: "Preacher broke up with his girlfriend to date Paige just for her to move away a day later #virginriver," as a fourth said: "Paige's whole storyline on this show has been dumb since season two. Like how they handled her killing Wes. It was so obviously self-defence. Everything after wasn't even necessary. Like was all this because they couldn't keep Lexa on the show full-time #VirginRiver."</p><p id=exN9_cQq1fn data-wc=24>A fifth asked:<strong>&nbsp;"How many times does Paige need to say goodbye and leave?</strong> Just be done with her storyline already. It's boring #VirginRiver."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0db3c039759d-mel-on-bridge-in-s5.jpg><p id=ek5ukYthbta data-wc=51>What else is there to expect from Virgin River season five? This is what the synopsis teases: "Season five features surprising new relationships, a shocking break-up, a difficult court trial, a heartbreaking goodbye, and a wildfire that threatens the town, bringing some people of Virgin River together while tearing others apart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3768d61cfa6e-virgin-river-jack-and-mel-s5.jpg><p id=e_c9DZJOtu8 data-wc=49>"Issues of motherhood push Mel to make a big decision about her future at the clinic while her pregnancy unexpectedly sparks an emotional connection to her past.
