Walton and his six-man group of loggers were returning home when they allegedly spotted a shiny disc spanning 40 feet in diameter hovering in the sky above them.</p><p>“It was a metallic, glowing disc, making some very strange sounds,” he recalled. “The closer I got to it, the more scared we all got and they were swearing at me to get away from there, and when I got up close, it suddenly got louder and started to move.”</p><p>Walton then claimed that “non-human” beings abducted him and experimented on him until he fought them off. He has maintained this claim for 45 years. But as the beings purportedly poked and prodded at him on a kind of table, five days elapsed on Earth where Walton was officially declared missing — and his coworkers became suspects.</p><p>“I became conscious inside the craft. And I believed I was in the hospital,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Walton. “I was in a lot of pain. And as I became more conscious, I looked around and I saw alien beings and I just panicked.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293208 alt="Travis Walton With Logging Gear" width=800 height=985 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/travis-walton-with-logging-gear.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293208 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Travis Walton</span><span class=caption-body>Travis Walton’s book about the incident was adapted into 1993’s alien abduction classic Fire In The Sky.</span></p><p>“They were much smaller than me, and I think that’s the reason they gave up,” he said, adding that he hit one of them. “Once they found out they couldn’t control me, they split. I was absolutely terrified.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Walton’s colleagues were questioned by authorities, and when Walton miraculously reappeared, a full-scale investigation was launched that included polygraphs, psychological evaluations, and physical examinations.</p><p>“For five days, the authorities thought he’d been murdered by his co-workers, and then he was returned,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> ufologist Jim Ledwith. “All of the co-workers who were there, who saw the spacecraft, they all took polygraph tests, and they all passed, except for one, and that one was inconclusive.”</p><p>In the end, the Walton case remains as inconclusive as all of these alien abduction stories do. Curiously, however, later research conducted at the site of Walton’s abduction showed an unusual growth rate in the trees where the craft had allegedly hovered.</p><p>The trees near the site were found to be producing wood fiber at a rate 36 times greater than they had in decades before.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyiuMiepWaZkpnCpMDIqKWsZ2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./namedaruma-taiho-kusuri.html><span>←</span><span>()</span></a>
