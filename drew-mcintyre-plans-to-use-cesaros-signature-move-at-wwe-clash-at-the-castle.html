While speaking on&nbsp;WWE’s The Bump, Drew McIntyre revealed that he plans to use Cesaro’s European Uppercut against Roman Reigns.</p><p>“Oh he’s getting one. I don’t bring em out too often, but it’s something I do like to use every so often. Like, if I can’t do that better than someone else, I don’t like to use them. And Cesaro was always around, and he’s not around right now. He was the one, the bar for me, no pun intended. Now that Cesaro is not around, I’ll bring that lifter back.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see how Drew McIntyre will fare against Roman Reigns. Fans would love to see McIntyre dethrone Reigns for the title, as unlikely as it seems.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Do you think Drew McIntyre will beat Roman Reigns?
