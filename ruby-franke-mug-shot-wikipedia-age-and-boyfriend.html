<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Ruby Franke Mug Shot Wikipedia, Age And Boyfriend</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Former family vlogger Ruby Franke co-owned the “8 Passengers” YouTube channel with her husband, Kevin Franke. Before it was removed from YouTube, the channel, which included recordings of their everyday lives with their six kids, had over 2.5 million followers. The YouTuber and her spouse advocated for strict parenting practices, including regulating their children’s social activities and withholding meals from hungry kids as a form of “punishment.” This prompted viewers to accuse one another of assault.</strong></p><h2><span id=Shot_of_Ruby_Franke_Mug>Shot of Ruby Franke Mug</span></h2><p>The former YouTuber was taken into custody by the authorities on August 30, 2022, in Springville, Utah, on two charges of second-degree aggravated child abuse. Jodi Hildebrandt, her business partner, was also taken into custody. Her admirers became very curious about the circumstances behind the “Ruby Franke mug shot” and her arrest as a result. A malnourished toddler wrapped in duct tape fled a house in search of food and water, alerting the police.</p><p>Two hospitalized, critically malnourished youngsters were discovered by the authorities at the residence. The house was cleared of four additional juveniles. The YouTuber, who is being detained without bond at the Washington County Jail, is shown in her mug photo winking while posing in front of a height chart while wearing a grey sweater. The mugshot represents a sharp decline in popularity for the once well-known YouTube mother, who attracted millions of viewers by projecting a picture of a contented, healthy family life.</p><p>As more alarming information about her parenting style comes out, the popular figure on the internet is now facing severe accusations that may result in years behind bars. Her meticulously manicured social media persona gives way to the brutal reality of suspected child abuse and neglect in this arresting police photo. She has not yet made her next court appearance as the inquiry is ongoing.</p><h2><span id=Ruby_Franke8217s_Age_and_Wikipedia_Page>Ruby Franke’s Age and Wikipedia Page</span></h2><p>Ruby Franke, née Donovan, became 43 in 2023. She was born on April 24, 1980. In 2001, she wed Kevin Franke. Her Wikipedia page was erased years ago along with the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, thus not much is known about her past. She depicted a picture-perfect family life on YouTube before her imprisonment, gaining millions of viewers and followers.</p><p>But behind the scenes, alarming reports of mistreatment surfaced. Along with her well-liked YouTube channel, the YouTuber’s Wikipedia article, which had previously documented her rise to viral stardom, was removed from the website. This purging of her internet presence suggests that she is attempting to disassociate herself from the contentious image that she has developed.</p><p>Her arrest on allegations of serious child abuse has caused her carefully constructed public persona to collapse. As social media sites scramble to remove the stuff that made her famous, not many remnants of her past notoriety are visible. Franke, 42, is facing a protracted court struggle and maybe even a prison sentence. The mother of six from Utah is starting a new chapter in her life, one that differs greatly from her time as an influencer celebrity.</p><p>Maybe people will stop thinking about her as quickly as her Wikipedia page disappears. But when her children’s pain comes to light, it casts a shadow on the former vlogger’s erased online legacy.</p><h2><span id=Ruby_Franke8217s_partner>Ruby Franke’s partner</span></h2><p>After 20 years of marriage, Ruby Franke revealed in 2021 that she and Kevin were splitting. Dax, who showed up in her Instagram pictures, and she quickly started dating. Although not much is known about Dax, it seems they connected through their membership in the “ConneXions” organization—a group some have referred to be a cult. Many concerns about what has transpired with her family and connections behind the scenes are brought up by her incarceration.</p><p>On social media, her daughter Shari hailed the arrest and claimed to have been attempting to notify authorities for years. The case is still in its early stages, and as the investigation progresses, more information probably will as well. However, these serious accusations of child abuse point to serious issues hiding behind the cheerful family-oriented YouTuber character.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Vlogger</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Paddy Payne Still Alive?
