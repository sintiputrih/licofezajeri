The star doesn't look to have changed so much from her teenage girl looks, a fact many of her fans who commented emphasized.</p><p class=dh>In her caption to the post, Kenya Moore clearly stated that the cute child in the picture wasn't her baby girl, Brooklyn, but her younger <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B99blRXJOIP/>brother. She wrote:</a></p><p class=dh>"Nope that's not @thebrooklyndaly that's me and my little brother.

Another fan said Kenya looked mature as a 13-year-old.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>The little tot had a mischievous look on her face, and made her way out of her mom's patio, wearing an animal print dress.</strong></h3><p class=dh>A third fan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B99blRXJOIP/>said the 49-year-old still</a> looked the same and is naturally beautiful, while a fourth person said that with all that hair, Kenya has always been good looking.</p><p class=dh>Kenya Moore is ever so proud of her one-year-old baby daughter, Brooklyn, and has many of her videos and pictures splashed over her Instagram page. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/B961grAJHuk/?igshid=1vqvqh51jn236">One of Kenya's recent posts</a> about her daughter was quite hilarious.</p><p class=dh>The video <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/03/19/kenya-moore-daughter-brooklyn-nyc-to-see-dad-marc>featured Brooklyn on a mission</a> to escape from home to see her father, Marc Daly, who is in New York City. Kenya shared the video on her Instagram page on March 19.</p><p class=dh>The little tot had a mischievous look on her face, and made her way out of her mom's patio, wearing an animal print dress.

Kenya managed to bring her back in, and narrated the incidence in her caption, with a pet dog also seen in the video, walking about.</p><p class=dh>However, Kenya's video derailed <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/03/21/that-baby-is-saying-doggie-not-daddy-kenya-moores-video-of-baby-brooklyn-derails-when-she-mentions-her-estranged-husband>when her fans mentioned that</a> Brooklyn didn't say "Daddy," but "Doggy" in the video, and that the television personality got the interpretation of her daughter's words wrong.</p><p class=dh>Other fans also believed that Kenya only wanted to mention Marc Daly, her estranged husband, in the video post.
