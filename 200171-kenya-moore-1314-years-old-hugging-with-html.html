The star doesn't look to have changed so much from her teenage girl looks, a fact many of her fans who commented emphasized.</p><p class=dh>In her caption to the post, Kenya Moore clearly stated that the cute child in the picture wasn't her baby girl, Brooklyn, but her younger <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B99blRXJOIP/>brother. She wrote:</a></p><p class=dh>"Nope that's not @thebrooklyndaly that's me and my little brother.

Kenya shared the video on her Instagram page on March 19.</p><p class=dh>The little tot had a mischievous look on her face, and made her way out of her mom's patio, wearing an animal print dress.

Kenya managed to bring her back in, and narrated the incidence in her caption, with a pet dog also seen in the video, walking about.</p><p class=dh>However, Kenya's video derailed <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/03/21/that-baby-is-saying-doggie-not-daddy-kenya-moores-video-of-baby-brooklyn-derails-when-she-mentions-her-estranged-husband>when her fans mentioned that</a> Brooklyn didn't say "Daddy," but "Doggy" in the video, and that the television personality got the interpretation of her daughter's words wrong.</p><p class=dh>Other fans also believed that Kenya only wanted to mention Marc Daly, her estranged husband, in the video post.
