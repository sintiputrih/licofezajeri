You don’t go unnoticed and your fearlessness is celebrated in our home everyday.”</p><p>However, Hilary didn’t seem impressed by her husband’s tongue-in-cheek post, responding in the comments, “You are truly ill. Matthew.” He had a quick reply for his wife, adding, “I'm so glad you're still here with us #survived,” adding an orange heart emoji.</p><p>Koma started the series of images with a picture of himself and Hilary, taken during a 2017 trip to Costa Rica, where he could be seen holding her romantically while they frolicked in the ocean.</p><p>Subsequent to that, another snapshot featured her strolling alongside celebrity fitness trainer Jason Walsh, the founder of Rise Nation, with whom Hilary had a five-month relationship in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, two photographs captured her on the beach with ex-partner Ely Sandvik, whom she dated during the summer of 2017 while she and Koma were taking a break from their romance.</p><p>Furthermore, Koma included a still from Duff's music video for "Chasing the Sun," wherein a model shared a close moment with her on the beach.
