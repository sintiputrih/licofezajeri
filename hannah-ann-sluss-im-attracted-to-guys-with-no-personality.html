And then I’m just sitting there just, like, talking to myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hannah-Ann-Sluss-Says-She-Attracted-To-Hot-Guys-With-No-Personality-Promo.jpg><p>Earlier this year, Sluss was introduced to Bachelor Nation when she competed for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Peter Weber</strong></a>‘s affections on season 24 of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelor. </a>The pilot, 29, proposed to her during the March finale, but fans learned that Weber<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> called off their engagement shortly </a>before the show started airing in January. The Virginia native explained he still had lingering feelings for runner-up <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Prewett</a>,</strong> whom he reunited with during the live finale special. However, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pair called it quits</a> two days later.</p><p>After the finale aired in March, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Weber moved on</a> with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kelley Flanagan</strong></a>, who finished in fifth place on the show.</p><p>Last month, Sluss told Us Weekly that she thinks her relationship with Weber would have been successful<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> if things played out differently.</a></p><p>“I think if we would have made it through, you know, the first year, I think we would have made it. I don’t know, I think that’s just me being positive,” she said in September. “The show is just really stressful, especially having to watch all that back. I feel like we would have made it through that, we would have definitely gotten married and made it through it because we both have family values, but I think sometimes it’s not about meeting the right person, sometimes it’s about the right time and place.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sluss added, “We just weren’t at the right time or place. And we’re not the right people for each other either, but you know what I mean.”</p><p>Although the model didn’t find love on The Bachelor, she would consider <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taking her chances as the Bachelorette.</a></p><p>“It all just depends on where I’m at in life,” she told Us. “I haven’t given up on love, I truly believe there’s someone out there for me, and I’m excited to meet them. I don’t know how we’ll meet them. But I know I’ll meet them and it might be in front of everyone else to see again, who knows, but not another national TV breakup.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZ6jrql5wKelZqucqsC0ecimZJqspKeupMDEnWStp12cwrq%2FjLCgraBdo7xuvMSrqqimkaG2tcWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./difference-between-location-and-place.html><span>←</span><span>Difference Between Location And Place</span></a>
