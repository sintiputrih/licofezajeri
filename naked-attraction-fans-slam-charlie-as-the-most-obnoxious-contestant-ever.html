Since it launched back in 2016, Naked Attraction has been shocking viewers with its approach to dating. Rather than go down the personality and ‘connection’ route, the Channel 4 show gets to the nitty-gritty and allows daters to pick their ideal match, based on pure physical attraction.
The new series kicked off on Thursday, January 10th and saw previous contestant Emmy-Lou return to the show hoping third time’s the charm."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Although we did some digging into Charlie, we could not find much about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Naked Attraction</span></a> star. However, as Charlie stated he loved living in Bournemouth, it’s most likely he is a student at Bournemouth University.</p><p>Charlie expressed that he had been going for personality when looking for a partner and it had not been a success. So, in a 180-turn, Charlie decided to base his date purely on her physical attributes.</p><p><i>And Charlie was not&nbsp;afraid to bring out his scientific side when it came to analysing the girls.</i></p><p>He had been single for around a year before entering the dating show.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FAKE ATTRACTION</a>:</strong> Has Anna Richardson had plastic surgery?

Charlie’s definitely not going to live this down for a while…</p><ul><li><b><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LOVE ISLAND LEAK</a>:</b> Connor Durman’s ‘ex-girlfriend’ says he broke up with her for the show</li></ul><p>https://twitter.com/AIM_Bandito/status/1215406629488861185</p><h3>Charlie’s Inbetweeners doppelgänger</h3><p>Although Charlie claimed his doppelgänger was Peter Crouch – and even performed ‘the robot’ to show off their similarities – that was not who viewers at home thought he resembled.</p><p>Instead, Naked Attraction fans thought Charlie was more Jay Cartwright from The Inbetweeners.</p><p>The character (played by James Buckley) is famous for being braggadocious about his sexual activity, despite the fact Jay is a virgin and totally inexperienced in the bedroom.</p><p>There were numerous viewers who took to Twitter to share the similarities. One Tweeted: “Getting a strong Jay from Inbetweeners vibe from this guy.” Another asked: “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Is Jay from Inbetweeners on tonight’s </span><span class=r-18u37iz>#nakedattraction</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">?”</span></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just remembered who Charlie reminds me of…Uncanny!! <a href=#>#nakedattraction</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kEUYKzgLlG</a></p><p>— Bob Ohn (@RichardHK83) <a href=#>January 9, 2020</a></p></figure>View Tweet<p style=text-align:center>WATCH NAKED ATTRACTION SERIES 6 THURSDAYS AT 10 PM ON CHANNEL 4</p><p style=text-align:center><strong><img decoding=async draggable=false src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f4f8.svg alt=? style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INSTAGRAM </a></span><strong>AND&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FACEBOOK</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLWius2eo2ZsX6OurLHDZpitrKKWsLW1zqdkn5meqHq0uMCmZJygkae5qrGMmqpmrJiaeq670q1kqJqepMWqu9SsZJynnqmytMDAp6tmnaaavw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-did-clinton-kelly-get-married.html><span>←</span><span>When did Clinton Kelly get married?
