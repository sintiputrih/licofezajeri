After a month since his last appearance and with the season coming to a close, Kyle is once again the “talk of the town.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportszion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kyle-Pitts-Kyle-Pitts-fantasy-football-outlook-Falcons.jpg><p>This season, Pitts has played a total of ten games where he ran 356 yards while making 28 receptions; with 12.7 receiving yards per reception, he made two receiving touchdowns. With Kyle’s immense potential, it can be said that the Falcon could not use his talent with accurate intensity.&nbsp;</p><p>As of late, rumors are circulating that the tight end might be traded to other teams, especially the Dallas Cowboys. The Dallas Cowboys showed interest in the player in 2021 when the world was locked in due to the pandemic. During that time, the Cowboys contacted the player asking questions regarding his skills and critical opponents.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=# rel=noopener>@gatorsfb</a>'s Kyle Pitts met with the <a href=# rel=noopener>#DallasCowboys</a> in a virtual meeting, discussing his unique skill set, how he’ll fit into an offense & which CB he faced last year was his toughest matchup. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OPCsMTlMV7</a></p><p>— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 21, 2021</a></p><p>However, it would be deplorable and unfair towards the player if the Falcons engaged him in a trade, as they cannot bring out the player’s true potential and utilize him.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=color:red>Titans RB Derrick Henry likely to benched vs Cowboys amid hip injury</span></a></li></ul><h2>Why are the Cowboys after Pitts?</h2><p>The cowboys have played superbly this season, with eleven clean victories out of fifteen encounters. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the team from Dallas in recent times is facing injury issues as their top running back- Tony Pollard is officially ruled questionable</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, the Cowboys have an excellent defensive lineup, and even though they are winning games, they want to destroy their opponents with a “freakish” attack.&nbsp;</p><p>Pitts was an intriguing player to watch in 2021, and he continues to stand out as a one-of-a-kind performer today. So the Cowboys must find out if there is any discontent in Atlanta or a feeling of “poor fit” if they are willing to get Kyle on board.</p><p>Which team is the perfect fit for Kyle Pitts?
